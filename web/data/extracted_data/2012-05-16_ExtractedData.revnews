Director Peter Berg has crafted an almost fetishistic homage to Michael Bay — like the \"Transformers\" series, this is yet another action extravaganza inspired by a Hasbro product — with its epic set pieces, swaggering bravado, panoramic skies and cheesy romance. It doesn't lean all the way into parody, but rather feels more like an affectionate and knowing approximation of a very specific, muscular genre: one of those the-world-is-ending-we're-all-gonna-die movies. And because it's a little cheeky and doesn't seem to take itself totally seriously, it's more enjoyable than one might expect from a movie based on a board game created in the 1960s. Yes, it can be deafeningly noisy between the crunch and shriek of giant metal objects fighting each other and the blaring rock anthems meant to pump up the crowd even further. No, it's not subtle between the annihilation caused by alien invaders and the rousing sense of patriotism that's the real weapon in this battle. But then again, would you really expect (or want) subtlety from this type of big-budget summer escape? Speaking of blockbusters, Taylor Kitsch gets more to work with here than he did earlier this year in \"John Carter\" as Alex Hopper. A slacker and troublemaker at the film's start, he joins the Navy at the insistence of his older brother, Stone (Alexander Skarsgard). A certain gorgeous blonde named Sam (Brooklyn Decker) also provides some inspiration. Flash-forward and Alex is a lieutenant on one Naval destroyer while Stone is the commanding officer of another. Both answer to Adm. Shane (a withering, well-cast Liam Neeson), who happens to be Sam's father.

Now, more than 10 years later, Sega is back with new video game hardware… but it’s definitely not the kind you might expect. Unveiled late last year, Sega’s “Toylet” is now available in Japan and the surrounding region. The system connects to a urinal, allowing users to play a variety of interactive games by urinating on a sensor connected to the main device. A screen above the system then displays each game to the player, examples of which include filling virtual coffee cans and blowing wind up a cartoon news anchor’s dress.
