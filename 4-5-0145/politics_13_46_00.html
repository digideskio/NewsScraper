     <title>Ugandan opposition activists defiant in face of ban</title>
     <description>
      KAMPALA (Reuters) - A group aligned to Uganda's opposition leader held a low-key rally on Thursday after the government declared it illegal, a move which has drawn condemnation from human rights groups. Opposition frontman Kizza Besigye and the Action4Change (A4C) campaign group have spearheaded a wave of demonstrations against the rising cost of living, prompting the authorities to crack down on their rallies. Ugandan police said they allowed Thursday's rally to go ahead because permission had been sought before the attorney general declared A4C illegal on Wednesday. ...

     <description>
      Six-term U.S. Rep. Tim Johnson was expected to announce Thursday he is abandoning his re-election bid, a move that would leave his Republican Party scrambling to find a replacement and fuel Democratic hopes of picking up seats and regaining control of the U.S. House.

     <title>Felon pleads not guilty to five San Francisco murders</title>
     <description>
      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A convicted felon who U.S. authorities tried but failed to deport to Vietnam in 2006 pleaded not guilty on Thursday to killing five people found murdered last month in a home in a quiet San Francisco neighborhood. Binh Thai Luc, 35, shook his head as he stood, shackled and dressed in a red jail-issued sweatshirt and pants, while the charges were read to him in court. A judge set his bail at $25 million. He faces five counts of murder with the special allegation of using a blunt instrument in the attack, the criminal complaint said. ...
