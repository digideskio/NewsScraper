      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Last year was both a good one and, it turns out, a bad one for soap opera actor Jack Wagner as his Samba to &quot;Lighting Up the Night&quot; spelled the end of his competing on &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot; on Tuesday. Wagner, 52, was sent packing during the TV show's &quot;most-memorable year&quot; themed week in which the dancers selected a particular year for inspiration. The actor, who was partnered with professional ballroom dancer Anna Trebunskaya, chose 2011 as his most memorable when he discovered he had a daughter. ...

Sunday night's Season 2 premiere easily trounced the impressive viewership of the show's series premiere last year and handily bested last season's average and finale viewership. Over three airings Sunday night, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; amassed 6.3 million total viewers, with the 9 p.m. premiere airing alone drawing 3.9 million viewers. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Netflix and Hulu are convincing millions of cable subscribers to cut the cord and dive into video streaming. That's the conclusion of a new report released this week by the Convergence Consulting Group, which found that&nbsp;2.65 million Americans canceled cable between 2008-2011 in favor of lower-cost Internet subscription services or video platforms. The Canadian research firm estimates that 112,000 U.S. and Canadian subscribers were added to the cable rolls in 2011. That represents a more than 50 percent drop from the 272,000 who signed up for the service in 2010. ...

      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - Mitt Romney has racked up some high profile endorsements in the last week, but his dad didn't get one from &quot;Mad Men&quot; character Henry Francis. On Sunday's episode, Betty's new husband received a work call while the couple waited for test results to see if she had cancer. Whoever was calling wanted Henry's boss, New York Mayor John Lindsay, to appear with Michigan Gov. George Romney. (This season, remember, is set in 1966.) Henry gave his caller the brush off: &quot;Well, tell Jim his honor's not going to Michigan. ...

     <title>DirecTV seeks FCC intervention in Tribune dispute</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - In a filing seeking FCC intervention in its dispute with Tribune Broadcasting, DirecTV blames &quot;the mess Tribune made of its operations leading into bankruptcy&quot; for Tribune stations going dark in 19 cities. The stations went dark for 5 million DirecTV customers over the weekend because of a dispute between the satellite provider and Tribune over retransmission fees. Twenty-three stations, as well as the national WGN America, stopped airing for DirecTV customers. ...

     <title>&quot;The Killing&quot; Season 2 premiere falters</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - &quot;The Killing&quot; must have felt a little bit wounded Monday morning. AMC's drama had its second season premiere Sunday night, and it appears that the series has dropped a number of viewers compared to its first season premiere. The initial airing of Sunday's two-hour premiere at 8 p.m. drew 1.8 million total viewers -- a good sight short of the 2.7 million total viewers who tuned in for its series premiere last April. With an 11 p.m. encore factored in, the premiere took in 2. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK, April 1 (TheWrap.com) - &quot;I don't think it makes any sense to try to get anyone to not talk,&quot; says Louie C.K., America's best standup comedian and the mastermind of one of its best shows. &quot;I think talking's always good. So whether it's the left or the right wing saying, 'You shouldn't get to talk,' I think all of that's silly and reactionary.&quot; He's standing in the most middle-American of places, a bowling alley. OK, it's a fancy one, in Manhattan. But a dingier section of Manhattan, on a corner next to a busy roadway. The Lucky Strike is the site that FX, which airs C.K. ...

      NEW YORK, April 1 (TheWrap.com) - Tribune Broadcasting television stations in 19 markets across the country were pulled from DirecTV at midnight Saturday because of a dispute over retransmission fees. Tribune is seeking retransmission compensation from DirecTV to carry 23 local stations -- including KTLA in Los Angeles and WPIX in New York -- and WGN America, Tribune's national network. Seeking to pressure DirecTV, Tribune set up a website for viewers to complain to the satellite TV company, and listed upcoming baseball games that fans will miss if no agreement is reached. ...
