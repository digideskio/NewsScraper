Of the 20 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters, 10 beat Wall Street sales estimates, with the biggest increases coming from clothing sellers.

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Tuesday as the market showed signs of fatigue after major indexes hit multiyear highs. Financial and energy stocks were the biggest decliners. But Apple Inc was up 1.8 percent near $629.59, supporting the Nasdaq as it outperformed other indexes.

      MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's public debt will surge to around 78 percent of gross domestic product this year, from 68 percent in 2011, Economy Minister Luis De Guindos told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. Spain's debt-to-GDP ratio is substantially lower than the other countries struggling most in Europe's debt crisis, but it is already well above the European Union's recommended 60 percent ceiling and will continue to rise largely due to its inability to generate growth while it cuts budget spending. ...
