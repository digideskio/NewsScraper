     <title>&quot;Bully&quot; pushes its way to $23K per-screen opening</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES, April 1 (TheWrap.com) - &quot;Bully,&quot; the Weinstein Co. documentary that sparked controversy after the MPAA rated it R -- and refused to change the rating even after nearly a half-million people signed a petition asking for the movie to be rated PG-13 -- opened to a remarkable $115,000 at five locations over the weekend. That works out to $23,000 per location -- the strongest opening of any documentary in 2012. The Weinstein Co. released the movie without a rating, rather than with the R that the MPAA gave it. Even as an unrated movie, it generated significant interest. ...
