Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 357,000, the lowest level since April 2008, the Labor Department said on Thursday. But the claims data could bolster the case that the healing labor market is lowering the need for the Federal Reserve to do more to boost growth. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Of the 20 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters, 10 beat Wall Street sales estimates, with the biggest increases coming from clothing sellers. Victoria's Secret parent Limited Brands Inc, Target Corp, Macy's Inc and Gap Inc were among the retailers that beat analysts' expectations for sales at stores open at least a year as they lured shoppers with blue, yellow and pink clothes and other spring merchandise. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Exclusive: China ship insurer deals new blow to Iran oil exports</title>
     <description>
      SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A major Chinese ship insurer will halt indemnity cover for tankers carrying Iranian oil from July, dealing a blow that narrows the insurance options for Tehran's main export already constricted by payment barriers caused by Western sanctions. With Western sanctions on Tehran increasing, sources at the China P&amp;I Club told Reuters on Thursday it did not want to stand alone in the market, especially after insurers in Japan and Europe plan to either limit or ban their own coverage for tankers operating in Iran. ...

     <title>Analysis: Cautious Wal-Mart missing out on Russia's retail boom</title>
     <description>
      MOSCOW (Reuters) - Retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc has let caution thwart its ambitions in Russia, and will find profits harder to come by if it delays getting a foothold in the vast market catering to 140 million people. Fearful of getting hamstrung by Russia's complicated and time-consuming bureaucracy, the world number one retailer has been outmaneuvered by its European peers - Auchan and Metro have become the third and fourth biggest food retailers in the $300 billion-plus market. ...

     <title>Asian banks warm to bond market innovation</title>
     <description>
      SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A&nbsp;shortage of U.S. dollars, new banking regulations and strong investor demand means Asian banks are set to help spur long-awaited innovation in the region's debt capital markets. Singapore is consulting on new guidelines to help its banks issue covered bonds and Hong Kong plans to study investor appetite for similar products, while banks across Asia are looking at forms of debt previously unseen in the region, such as hybrid or perpetual bonds. ...

The governor had just been publicly heckled by politicians over seemingly endless deflation and a yen near record highs. Bold steps were needed to restore the BOJ's standing, and quickly. &quot;Until February, the BOJ's message was that mild deflation was inevitable, and that it didn't need to act as long as the economy was doing fine,&quot; said a source familiar with the central bank's thinking. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The governor had just been publicly heckled by politicians over seemingly endless deflation and a yen near record highs. Bold steps were needed to restore the BOJ's standing, and quickly. &quot;Until February, the BOJ's message was that mild deflation was inevitable, and that it didn't need to act as long as the economy was doing fine,&quot; said a source familiar with the central bank's thinking. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England is set to leave its policy settings on hold on Thursday as the economy looks to have skirted recession although a shock slump in February factory output served as a reminder that the economy is not on a sound footing yet. The British economy has not recovered fully from the 2007-2009 slump and a contraction in the final three months of last year, due in part to the escalating euro zone debt crisis, had stoked fears of a new recession. ...
