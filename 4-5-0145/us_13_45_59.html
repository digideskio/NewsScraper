     <title>JetBlue still upbeat, but not darling it once was</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JetBlue's emergency response team barely had time to locate the Incident Operations Center at their new headquarters in Long Island City, Queens when they were summoned there to handle an emergency on March 27, a day after they moved in. JetBlue pilot Clayton Osbon was behaving erratically on Flight 191 from New York to Las Vegas, running through the cabin screaming about religion and terrorists. Passengers tackled him in the galley. The plane had to be diverted to Amarillo, Texas, where a co-pilot guided it to a safe landing. ...

      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A convicted felon who U.S. authorities tried but failed to deport to Vietnam in 2006 pleaded not guilty on Thursday to killing five people found murdered last month in a home in a quiet San Francisco neighborhood. Binh Thai Luc, 35, shook his head as he stood, shackled and dressed in a red jail-issued sweatshirt and pants, while the charges were read to him in court. A judge set his bail at $25 million. He faces five counts of murder with the special allegation of using a blunt instrument in the attack, the criminal complaint said. ...

     <title>Wyoming town, population 1, sells for $900,000</title>

      SALMON, Idaho (Reuters) - The town of Buford, Wyoming - population 1 - was sold for $900,000 to an unidentified buyer on Thursday after an 11-minute auction that attracted worldwide interest. The tiny Western town garnered international attention in advance of the sale of 10-plus acres with a convenience store, gas station and modular home located in southeast Wyoming between Cheyenne and Laramie. Don Sammons and his wife, Terry, moved from Los Angeles to the Buford area in 1980. In 1992, six years after Terry's death, Sammons purchased the town. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. courts have authority to decide whether President Barack Obama's healthcare law is valid under the Constitution, his attorney general told a court on Thursday in a further bid to defuse a controversy Obama ignited earlier this week. After Obama appeared to question the role of the courts in reviewing the two-year-old law expanding healthcare coverage to 30 million-plus uninsured Americans, a conservative judge in Texas on the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the administration to explain itself. ...

      April 5 (IFR) - San Francisco-based start-up lender SoFi has a novel idea to revive the moribund market in student-loan bonds -- get alumni to invest in their schools. More precisely, get them to invest in securities backed by loans to their schools' students, who would in turn benefit from interest rates below the current rate on federal loans. &quot;Students get a lower interest rate, and alumni get a way to support their university while earning a financial return,&quot; Mike Cagney, SoFi CEO and chairman, told IFR. ...

Penney Co Inc said on Thursday that it will cut about 900 jobs, including roughly 600 at its headquarters, as it trims costs and tries to start running its 110-year-old business more like a nimble start-up. The Plano, Texas-based retailer, which has already overhauled its pricing strategy under new chief executive Ron Johnson, said it plans to close a customer call center in Pittsburgh, affecting about 300 employees. The roughly 600 workers being let go in Plano represent about 15 percent of the staff at the company's main office. ...
