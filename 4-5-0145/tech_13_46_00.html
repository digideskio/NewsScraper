      Electric cars are known for being quiet — perhaps a little too quiet. U.S. law requires electric car manufacturers to add&nbsp;fake engine sounds to their vehicles to help alert pedestrians and other drivers of the vehicles presence.

     <title>Sold Out by Allies, LulzSec Hacker Pleads Guilty</title>
     <description>
      Lulz Security really wanted to make it clear that its huge dump of Sony Playstation Network user data in June 2011 was&nbsp;very easy to pull off, and a lot of fun, but&nbsp;now that a culprit has pleaded guilty, he faces years in prison after getting entirely sold out. Far less fun. Of course, 24-year-old Cody Kretsinger probably won't get close to the maximum sentence of 15 years, but at this point he's got to be wondering if it was all worth it -- especially since the key people supposed to have his back in the operation turned out to be working for the FBI.

One of the most coveted stock listings in recent years, Facebook's choice of its future exchange translates into a relatively small sum in annual listing fees. But it bestows major bragging rights on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc, already home to the likes of Apple Inc and Google Inc.
