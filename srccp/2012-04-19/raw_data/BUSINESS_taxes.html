     <title>IRS rule threatens bank capital flight: analysts</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Banks in Texas, Florida and other southern states could face a pull-out of non-U.S. depositors due to a new U.S. rule finalized on Tuesday, industry analysts said. The rule issued by the Internal Revenue Service will require U.S. banks, starting on January 1, 2013, to report to the IRS payments of interest made to non-resident aliens. &quot;The reporting required by these regulations is essential to the U.S. government's efforts to combat offshore tax evasion,&quot; said an IRS statement announcing the rules' finalization. ...

     <title>First Person: I Was on the Hook for $2,500</title>
     <description>
      I had a horrible closing as a real estate attorney in my first year of self-employment in 2006. I did a purchase closing where the seller was represented by a real estate agent that we trusted and had done a lot of closings before. When we did the title search, we found a federal tax lien against the seller. We brought this to the attention of the agent; &quot;magically&quot;, she procured a satisfaction of the tax lien. We carried on with the closing and everything seemed fine.

     <title>First Person: My $139,000 Tax Bill</title>
     <description>
      In March 2007, I submitted my income information to my tax planner. During 2006, I had tinkered with day trading stocks and had made a small ($2,000-$3,000) profit on sales of over a million dollars. I received my tax documents back and was overjoyed to note that I only owed the Internal Revenue Service around $200 and the Commonwealth of Virginia even less. I promptly mailed my tax forms to the appropriate agencies and forgot about the matter.
