It's produced by FremantleMedia North America and will debut on June 7 at 8 p.m. His roots are in stand-up comedy, but Lopez is probably best known for starring in his self-produced sitcom &quot;George Lopez,&quot; which ran on ABC from 2002-2007. He hosted the TBS late-night talk show &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot; on TBS until it was canceled in August of last year. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - RaeLynn of Team Blake and Ashley De La Rosa of Team Christina were sent home from popular TV singing competition &quot;The Voice&quot; on Tuesday night. Host Carson Daly pressed a hesitating coach Blake Shelton to choose between RaeLynn, who goes by her first name, and teammate Erin Willett as the show's credits began to role. After some hemming and hawing, country singer Shelton announced he was keeping Willett. Raelynn, who sang &quot;If I Die Young&quot; by The Band Perry, hugged Willett and appeared to tear up as the show ended. ...

It's a tableau that could be straight out of Tehran. But instead it's a scene from a reality television show shot in Europe and broadcast by satellite from studios in southwest London. With light fare like &quot;Befarmaeed Sham,&quot; (&quot;Welcome to Dinner&quot; in Persian), the Iranian answer to the UK cooking show &quot;Come Dine With Me,&quot; family-owned channel Manoto 1 has struck a chord inside Iran, gaining what is likely to be millions of fans since launching in 2010. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

It's a tableau that could be straight out of Tehran. But instead it's a scene from a reality television show shot in Europe and broadcast by satellite from studios in southwest London. With light fare like &quot;Befarmaeed Sham,&quot; (&quot;Welcome to Dinner&quot; in Persian), the Iranian answer to the UK cooking show &quot;Come Dine With Me,&quot; family-owned channel Manoto 1 has struck a chord inside Iran, gaining what is likely to be millions of fans since launching in 2010. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Two months after its San Diego debut, canine cable channel DogTV is keeping tails wagging at a local animal shelter, is available on the Internet and is headed for national distribution, an executive for the enterprise said on Tuesday. The advertising-free programming is aimed at stay-at-home pooches whose work-a-day masters fret about the separation anxiety their pets suffer, and the trouble they get into, when left unattended for long stretches of time. ...

      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Selina Meyer is a U.S. vice president whose office has anti-suicide windows, whose boss never calls, and whose jaded press secretary pretends to have a dog (dubbed a 'bull-shitzu') so that he won't have to stay late at work. Sounds familiar? Armando Iannucci, the creator of HBO's new satirical TV series &quot;Veep&quot;, hopes it all rings true because he knows Washington will be watching his cynical view of a political system where idealism has been trumped by compromise and endless damage control. &quot;Veep&quot;, which premieres on Sunday and in a U.S. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - &quot;The Simpsons&quot; used its blackboard opening sequence Sunday to reveal that Springfield is located ... somewhere far from you. &quot;The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours,&quot; Bart wrote on the blackboard in the opening of Sunday's &quot;Beware My Cheating Bart&quot; episode. That followed the beginning of the opening sequence, which read &quot;The Simpsons Now Entering Oregon.&quot; &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening said in an interview in the new issue of Smithsonian magazine that he named Springfield after the town in Oregon, which is near his hometown, Portland. ...

     <title>Investigation Discovery scares up women viewers</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - Investigation Discovery is growing fast with an old trick for luring its predominantly female viewers: Scaring and titillating them with stories of shocking crimes, then making them feel like they can help catch the perpetrators. Along the way, the network says, they may even learn to avoid becoming victims. Investigation Discovery's lineup includes a slew of shows that prey on women's fears of murderous husbands or mystery assailants out to abduct them or their children. ...

Allison Coss and Scott Sippola were convicted in 2010 of concocting an elaborate plot to extort money from Stamos by threatening to release pictures of him at a party where there were strippers and cocaine.

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Roger Ailes probably should probably hire a new joke writer. The Fox News president made headlines Friday after taking an inexplicable -- and not particularly witty -- dig at CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien. The comment came during an appearance at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday. Ailes was on campus as part of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication's Roy H. Park Distinguished Lecture Series, but one particular comment from Ailes wasn't particularly distinguished at all. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Sorry, Seth MacFarlane fans: when it comes to his planned &quot;Flintstones&quot; reboot, the operative phrase is now, &quot;Yabba Dabba Don't.&quot; The revamp of the classic cartoon about a prehistoric working schlub and his family, which was to air on Fox, has been put on ice indefinitely, due to schedule concerns on MacFarlane's part. Fox announced the series last May with a plan to premiere the new &quot;Flintstones&quot; in 2013. Though the news may disappoint, it's hardly surprising that MacFarlane should find his plate too full. ...
