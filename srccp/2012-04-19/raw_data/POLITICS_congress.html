     <title>Republican business tax cut seen passing U.S. House</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives was on track on Thursday to pass a tax break for small businesses, pushing back against President Barack Obama's politically popular &quot;Buffett Rule&quot; that would put a new minimum tax on the very wealthy. In an escalating election-year war of words over taxes, the Republican measure was not expected to become law.

     <title>Turmoil at U.S. nuclear regulator spills into Congress</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A toxic internal battle that has scarred the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission as it works on historic reforms now threatens to hold up the work of the U.S. Senate as leaders spar over an opening on the five-member panel. Senate Republican leaders want the White House to renominate Kristine Svinicki, a Republican whose term expires in June. Republicans believe the process is being held up because she, along with three other commission members, accused the current NRC chairman, a Democrat, of bullying women. ...
