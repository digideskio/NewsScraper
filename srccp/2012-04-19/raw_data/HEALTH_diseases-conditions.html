     <title>China study finds mine workers at higher risk of cancer, heart disease</title>

Silica is a compound found in sand and rock. When rocks are drilled or broken, fine silica dust particles are produced that lodge deep in the lungs and can lead to scarring, severe respiratory problems and death. ...

     <title>My battle with breast cancer: Alternative medicine</title>
     <description>
      Alternative medicine is an important part of my cancer treatment. These treatments are not going to cure my cancer, but they play an important role in relieving chemo symptoms, pain and helping to replace prescription drugs. My insurance covers some of the treatments. I do not get coverage for supplements that can be purchased over-the-counter.
