     <title>&quot;Spider-man&quot; trailer has more lizard, daddy issues</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Peter Parker has a whole lot of daddy issues and a scaly, slithering, super-freaky villain to deal with in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man.&quot; That's the take-away from a new international trailer for the upcoming reboot of Sony's superhero franchise. The latest preview gives audiences a more extensive look at Rhys Ifans' villainous Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard, who is big, green and administering a smack-down on Manhattan motorists. This reptilian baddie has serious road-rage. It also appears that the orphaned Peter's father had some kind of business association with Connors. ...

     <title>3D 'Titanic' posts China's best box office bow ever</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap) - The 3D re-release of &quot;Titanic&quot; recorded the best box office opening ever in China this weekend, claiming $58 million for international distributor Fox. Universal got some good news, too. It opened its pricey &quot;Battleship&quot; in 26 territories - not including China - and took in $58 million. That represents a pretty good payoff on the studio's early overseas opening strategy. The movie will roll out in the U.S. on May 18. The huge China opening for &quot;Titanic&quot; and receipts from 69 other territories upped the global haul in its second overseas weekend to $88.2 million. ...

The film, which stars Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penelope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page, had its world premiere in the Eternal City on Friday. Made up of four separate stories, it is his first set in Rome, which Allen called &quot;a feast for a filmmaker&quot;. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The film, which stars Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penelope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page, had its world premiere in the Eternal City on Friday.

The actress's maiden tweet was a typical bit of witticism (or is that White-icism?) designed to enchant and delight the masses. &quot;Hello Twitter! And they said it would never happen. Oh wait, that was me,&quot; White cracked. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Review: Efron is all grown up in 'The Lucky One'</title>
     <description>
      &quot;The Lucky One&quot; is yet another adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, so you know exactly what you're getting walking into this thing. It's predictable and schmaltzy and sappy and smothered with voiceover that explains the film's already none-too-subtle themes of destiny and fate and second chances.
