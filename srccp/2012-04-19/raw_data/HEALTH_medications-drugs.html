     <title>Acne drug tied to a doubled risk of eye problems</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Prescription pills used to treat severe acne were linked to a two-fold risk of developing eye problems, such as pink eye, styes and dryness, in a large new study from Israel. Isotretinoin, which goes by brand names including Roaccutane, Claravis and Amnesteem, is known to have serious side effects, such as bone growth delays in teenagers and miscarriages and birth defects when taken by pregnant women. The medications are quite popular, however, for treating severe cases of acne in both teens and adults. ...

In the U.S., about 11 percent of adults have chronic kidney disease, the vast majority of whom have early-stage disease. The disease is very common among older adults -- more than 44 percent of Americans older than 70 have it -- and high blood pressure and diabetes are the main risk factors. In its early stages, chronic kidney disease usually has no symptoms. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Spain seeks health care cuts as crisis deepens</title>
     <description>
      MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's government met regional officials on Wednesday to agree ways to cut state healthcare, an attack on a treasured welfare system that will fuel anger among a population weary of EU-enforced austerity to tackle a ballooning deficit. The conservative government has warned Spaniards they would have to start paying more for prescriptions, part of the welfare system that has provided state-financed health and education since the country's transition to democracy began in the 1970s. ...

     <title>What does Caraco court win mean for generic drug companies?</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan had fun with semantics in Tuesday's unanimous ruling in the Caraco Pharmaceutical versus Novo Nordisk case in which pharmaceutical companies faced off against generic drug makers. At issue was a 2003 law with a loophole used by brand-name drug makers to keep generic competitors off the market. Faced with expiring patents on successful drugs, brand makers in the 1990s began extending their monopoly rights by obtaining &quot;method&quot; patents on use of the medications. Such patents could give brand-makers longer exclusivity, but the U.S. ...
