     <title>Ex-Venezuelan Supreme Court justice attacks judicial 'manipulation'</title>
     <description>
      MIAMI (Reuters) - A Venezuelan Supreme Court judge who was removed from his post last month for assisting a drug trafficker has accused his former government bosses of systematic manipulation of the courts, including meddling in drug cases. Eladio Aponte fled Venezuela two weeks ago and sought refuge in Costa Rica, where he was in contact with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, according to local officials. &quot;It's very corrupt at every single level. There's a lot of manipulation,&quot; Aponte said in an interview with a Miami-based Spanish-language TV station, Soi TV, broadcast on Wednesday. ...

     <title>Animal sacrifice case underpins Guantanamo legal challenge</title>
     <description>
      MIAMI (Reuters) - A pending challenge to the jurisdiction of the Guantanamo war crimes tribunals relies in part on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right of Santeria priests in Florida to sacrifice chickens during religious ceremonies. The ruling was easily the most unusual cited last week in pretrial hearings for Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, a Saudi prisoner who could face the death penalty if convicted of orchestrating a suicide bomb attack that killed 17 U.S. sailors aboard the warship USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden. It was part of a larger defense argument that the U.S. ...

     <title>Court says Arizona can demand voter identification</title>
     <description>
      PHOENIX (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday ruled Arizona may require voters to show identification at the polls, a ruling likely to add fuel to the fiery debate about voting rights in a presidential election year. But the court also ruled the state cannot demand that they show proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, a decision the state's attorney general said he would appeal. That could set the stage for yet another U.S. Supreme Court showdown over a contentious Arizona law touching on citizenship issues. ...

     <title>What does Caraco court win mean for generic drug companies?</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan had fun with semantics in Tuesday's unanimous ruling in the Caraco Pharmaceutical versus Novo Nordisk case in which pharmaceutical companies faced off against generic drug makers. At issue was a 2003 law with a loophole used by brand-name drug makers to keep generic competitors off the market. Faced with expiring patents on successful drugs, brand makers in the 1990s began extending their monopoly rights by obtaining &quot;method&quot; patents on use of the medications. Such patents could give brand-makers longer exclusivity, but the U.S. ...

     <title>&quot;Shock jock&quot; Stern lawsuit vs Sirius XM thrown out</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - A judge has dismissed radio DJ Howard Stern's $330 million lawsuit accusing Sirius XM Radio of failing to pay him stock awards he was due for helping the dominant U.S. satellite radio company exceed growth targets. New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick in Manhattan said Stern and his agent Don Buchwald were bound by the language of the 2004 agreement that brought the now 58-year-old &quot;shock jock&quot; to what became Sirius XM from traditional radio. ...

     <title>Supreme Court takes another look at gray market resales</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - The Supreme Court has decided to take a second crack at reconciling two apparently contradictory provisions in the Copyright Act: one that permits buyers to resell goods without worrying about permission from U.S. copyright holders, and another that controls the importation of copyrighted material into the United States. It may sound arcane, but this is a hugely-consequential issue. ...
