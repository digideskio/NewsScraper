     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Classically trained Canadian chef Douglas McNish was overweight and unhappy when he decided he needed to make a change in his life and his diet, and he hasn't looked back since. In his first cookbook, &quot;Eat Raw, Eat Well,&quot; the 29-year-old Toronto-based executive chef, teacher and raw food consultant provides 400 raw, vegan and gluten-free recipes and explains why he switched from a traditional diet and cooking steaks professionally and decided to give up meat and become a vegan and then a raw food chief. &quot;One day I woke up and decided to change my life. ...

Whenever she smiled, cameras clicked and crowds roared with approval. She was just 14 at the time and apparently living the ultimate American dream. Or so it seemed. The medals, the cheesy grin, even the bear, were all just a mask for the demons she was battling. Privately, her life was starting to unravel. Her parents had just divorced and she did not know how to cope. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Whitney Houston's &quot;Bodyguard&quot; co-star didn't just play her protector on the big screen -- he also tried to keep her safe in real life in his own way.

     <title>&quot;Northeast Kingdom&quot; a treasure trove for writer</title>
     <description>
      TOKYO (Reuters) - The writer Howard Frank Mosher has lived for nearly half a century in such a remote part of the northern U.S. state of Vermont that Internet connections are very slow and even landline phone reception can be terrible at times. Yet the area known as the &quot;Northeast Kingdom&quot; - the three northeasternmost counties in the state - proved to be such a fertile source of inspiration that Mosher, born in 1942 and with 12 books behind him, has ended up spending most of his life there. ...
