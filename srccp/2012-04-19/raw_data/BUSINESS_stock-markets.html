     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Wednesday, a day after Wall Street's best gains in a month, as uninspiring earnings from tech bellwethers IBM and Intel gave investors a reason to take profits. Chesapeake Energy Corp dropped 5.5 percent to $18.06 and was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange after a Reuters report that CEO Aubrey K. McClendon did not disclose loans of as much as $1.1 billion over the last three years against his stake in thousands of the company's oil and natural gas wells. The stock fell as low as $17.17, its lowest since July 2009. ...
