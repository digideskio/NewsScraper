The CEO’s&nbsp;testimony&nbsp;is rather puzzling —&nbsp;Page has previously claimed the company’s Android platform was “on fire” and a “tremendous example of the power of partnership” that “gets better with each version.” During an&nbsp;earnings call in October, Page&nbsp;said the company was “seeing a huge positive revenue impact from mobile, which has grown 2.5 times in the last 12 months to a run rate of over $2.5 billion.”&nbsp;Furthermore,&nbsp;Google’s $12.5 billion&nbsp;acquisition&nbsp;of Motorola Mobility&nbsp;was meant to protect Android&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Twitter said the move would give inventors more control over their creations and ensure its patents are not used to &quot;impede the innovation of others,&quot; the company said in a post on its official blog. &quot;It is a commitment from Twitter to our employees that patents can only be used for defensive purposes. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

PCWorld put the carriers claims to test in its “2012 Mobile Speed Test” and found that AT&amp;T’s 4G LTE service featured the fastest download speeds while Verizon’s 4G LTE network provided the fastest upload speeds. T-Mobile’s HSPA+ 21 network was the fastest 3G service and the carrier’s HSPA+ 42 service held its own with both AT&amp;T’s and Verizon’s 4G networks, making T-Mobile a good choice for many wireless users who are looking for affordable plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
