The outsize influence of Apple on both the technology sector and the entire stock market was thrown into sharp relief when the iPad maker's shares fell 4.1 percent on Monday. The alpha male of the stock market, Apple accounts for a third of the S&amp;P tech sector's 20 percent year-to-date return, the best performance of any of the 10 sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index this year. The problem is, Apple's success may be masking a larger trend in the wider market toward slower profit growth. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

It's a strategy the Canadian company hopes will help fill both a hole in its balance sheet and a half-year wait for its next big thing — the BlackBerry 10 platform. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>On the Call: Intel CEO Otellini talks tablets</title>
     <description>
      Intel Corp. is gearing up for its biggest marketing campaign in years, to support &quot;ultrabooks,&quot; which are thin, light laptops. That's happening while it faces a challenge from another kind of thin, light computer: the tablet, exemplified by Apple's iPad, which doesn't use Intel chips.

      (Reuters) - Intel forecast better than expected revenue and said the first Intel-chip-based smartphones will emerge this quarter, marking its response to a consumer shift toward tablets and other mobile gadgets.

Completing a trio of major earnings released on Tuesday, Yahoo Inc, which is going through a massive internal overhaul, posted better than expected earnings. ...
