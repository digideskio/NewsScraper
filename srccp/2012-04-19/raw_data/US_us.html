     <title>Nebraska votes to offer prenatal care to illegal immigrants</title>
     <description>
      OMAHA, Neb (Reuters) - The Nebraska legislature voted on Wednesday to provide prenatal care to illegal immigrants under a government program for the poor, overriding Governor Dave Heineman's veto of the proposal. Heineman, a Republican, had vetoed the measure last week, saying he opposed providing taxpayer benefits to illegal immigrants. About 1,600 low-income women were affected when Nebraska eliminated the program in 2010. About half were illegal immigrants and others were women who lost benefits for failing to comply with all requirements. ...

     <title>Republican business tax cut seen passing U.S. House</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives was on track on Thursday to pass a tax break for small businesses, pushing back against President Barack Obama's politically popular &quot;Buffett Rule&quot; that would put a new minimum tax on the very wealthy. In an escalating election-year war of words over taxes, the Republican measure was not expected to become law. It is opposed by Democrats, who control the Senate, where the bill was expected to die. ...

      HOUSTON (Reuters) - Union workers at Tesoro Corp's 97,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles Refinery in Wilmington, California, voted to authorize a strike if talks with company management for a new agreement are unsuccessful, a spokeswoman for the United Steelworkers Union (USW) said on Wednesday. The local USW union at the Los Angeles Refinery is fourth representing a Tesoro plant to authorize a strike, but no work stoppage is expected before the contract for the Los Angeles Refinery workers expires on April 30. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Authorities said the pilot of a small plane circling over the Gulf of Mexico near Florida on Thursday was not responding to radio calls. The privately owned Cessna was enroute to Sarasota, Florida, from Slidell, Louisiana, and air traffic controllers lost contact with the pilot after it took off, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said. The plane was at 20,000 feet, circling 150 miles South of Crestview, Florida, and due to run out of fuel, the spokeswoman said. It may have already crashed into Gulf waters. ...

Merle Butler, 65, a former insurance agent, and Patricia Butler, 62, who worked at several companies, retiring nearly five years ago from investment firm Edwards Jones, are the only winners of the March 30 jackpot to publicly identify themselves. Illinois requires winners' identities to be revealed. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Israel Keyes, 34, was accused of murdering 18-year-old Samantha Koenig, whose body was found in early April in an ice-covered lake just outside of Anchorage two months after she was snatched from the coffee stand at the end of her shift. ...

     <title>Nebraska votes to offer prenatal care to illegal immigrants</title>
     <description>
      OMAHA, Neb (Reuters) - The Nebraska legislature voted on Wednesday to provide prenatal care to illegal immigrants under a government program for the poor, overriding Governor Dave Heineman's veto of the proposal. Heineman, a Republican, had vetoed the measure last week, saying he opposed providing taxpayer benefits to illegal immigrants. About 1,600 low-income women were affected when Nebraska eliminated the program in 2010. About half were illegal immigrants and others were women who lost benefits for failing to comply with all requirements. ...

     <title>Teen pleads guilty to weapons charge in Utah school bomb plot</title>
     <description>
      SALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - A 16-year-old boy who authorities said plotted to bomb his Utah high school, inspired by the 1999 Columbine school massacre, has pleaded guilty to a weapons charge, and prosecutors recommended he spend six months in juvenile detention. The teenager entered the plea on Tuesday in juvenile court in Ogden, Utah, to one count of possession or use of a weapon of mass destruction, court spokeswoman Nancy Volmer said. Prosecutors said the teen, who attended Roy High School about 30 miles north of Salt Lake City, was serious about carrying out the bomb plot. ...

     <title>Animal sacrifice case underpins Guantanamo legal challenge</title>
     <description>
      MIAMI (Reuters) - A pending challenge to the jurisdiction of the Guantanamo war crimes tribunals relies in part on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right of Santeria priests in Florida to sacrifice chickens during religious ceremonies. The ruling was easily the most unusual cited last week in pretrial hearings for Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, a Saudi prisoner who could face the death penalty if convicted of orchestrating a suicide bomb attack that killed 17 U.S. sailors aboard the warship USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden. It was part of a larger defense argument that the U.S. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc has won a U.S. appeals court's dismissal of a $1 billion lawsuit over the contents of its credit card receipts, in a decision questioning why anyone should care how the oil company acted. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago said Shell's printing of the last four digits of account numbers on receipts complied with the federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which allows the printing of as many as the last five digits of a &quot;card number. ...

The cuts advanced by the House of Representatives Agriculture Committee on Wednesday would reduce spending on food stamps that help 46 million people buy food by $7.7 billion in the first year, by $19.7 billion in five years, and the balance in the next five years.

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Authorities said the pilot of a small plane circling over the Gulf of Mexico near Florida on Thursday was not responding to radio calls. The privately owned Cessna was enroute to Sarasota, Florida, from Slidell, Louisiana, and air traffic controllers lost contact with the pilot after it took off, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said. The plane was at 20,000 feet, circling 150 miles South of Crestview, Florida, and due to run out of fuel, the spokeswoman said. It may have already crashed into Gulf waters. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives was on track on Thursday to pass a tax break for small businesses, pushing back against President Barack Obama's politically popular &quot;Buffett Rule&quot; that would put a new minimum tax on the very wealthy. In an escalating election-year war of words over taxes, the Republican measure was not expected to become law. It is opposed by Democrats, who control the Senate, where the bill was expected to die. ...
