The wireless company is accused of tax fraud for deliberately not collecting or paying more than $100 million in taxes over the past seven years.

The largest Internet IPO to date was Google’s 2004 offering, which raised $1.9 billion. Facebook’s shares will reportedly be listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the “FB” ticker symbol.
