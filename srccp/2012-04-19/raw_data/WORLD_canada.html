Thanks to low borrowing costs, household spending and business investment will power Canada's moderate economic growth through the end of 2014, while exports remain weak and high oil prices fail to bring the usual benefits, the central bank said in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Canada cable firms warn of U.S.-style blackouts</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - Television blackouts could happen in Canada as they occasionally do in the United States if television broadcasters are allowed to charge cable companies fees for their signals, Canadian cable-TV firms warned on Tuesday. In arguments before the Supreme Court of Canada, the cable companies said a value-for-signal plan advocated by broadcasters violates Parliament's intent for stable, affordable access to television as a cornerstone of cultural and communications policy. &quot;Canada for 50 years has avoided blackouts. Look at the U.S. ...

     <title>Sleepy Air Canada pilot thought Venus was a plane</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - A sleepy Air Canada pilot first mistook the planet Venus for an aircraft, and then sent his airliner diving toward the Atlantic to prevent an imaginary collision with another plane, an official report said on Monday. Sixteen passengers and crew were hurt in the January 2011 incident, when the first officer rammed the control stick forward to avoid a U.S. plane he wrongly thought was heading straight toward him. ...

No reason was given for the decision and a brief statement said only that the two had concluded their coaching relationship and that Christy Krall resigned from Chan's team. Krall is based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and coached Chan to world titles in 2011 and last month in Nice, France. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
