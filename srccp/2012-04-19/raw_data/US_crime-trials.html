     <title>Montenegrin journalist given prison term for libel</title>

     <title>Ohio's Death Penalty Moratorium Didn't Last Very Long</title>
     <description>
      The state of Ohio plans to execute convicted killer&nbsp;Mark Wiles on Wednesday, ending an unofficial ban on the practice that lasted all of six months. Wiles will be executed by lethal injection for murdering a 15-year-old boy during a robbery of a farmhouse in 1985. He will be the 47th person executed in Ohio since the state resumed the death penalty in 1999.
