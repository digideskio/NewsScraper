Think about the impact you would feel emotionally as you watch several of your closest friends die at the hands of rogue terrorists who want you to join your friends in similar body bags. Consider how you would react if you saw your friends body being desecrated and dragged through a village square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Afghan Abuse Photos: Military Veterans' Takes</title>
     <description>
      What prompted the photography of dead Afghan insurgents in 2010 -- and the subsequent leak to the Los Angeles Times two years later -- is far more complex than military discipline gone awry or soldiers blowing off steam, say some U.S. military veterans.

     <title>GSA Spending: Don't Blame Bush or Obama</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Is anyone really surprised about the General Services Administration mess? Every day it seems something new comes out about lavish vacations, conferences and a general disregard for the taxpayers' money. As pointed out by the Associated Press, outrage is bipartisan in nature -- as it should be.

     <title>Killing for a Baby Is Crazy and Desperate</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to the Associated Press, Verna McClain told her sister she was planning to adopt a newborn. Then she went to a Houston pediatrician's office, killed a new mother in the parking lot and kidnapped a 3-day-old child. As unbelievable and horrific as the crime is, McClain is just the latest in a long line of women who would do anything to have a baby. And at least one forensic psychiatrist says the phenomenon is generally the result of self-focused desperation, not mental illness.

     <title>Ted Nugent's Anti-Obama Rants Aren't Threatening</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Motor City Madman, Ted Nugent, is ragging on President Barack Obama again. The gun rights activist shot off his mouth at a National Rifle Association dinner. He's more bark than bite, but the Secret Service doesn't see it that way. The Associated Press says it will pay Nugent a call on Thursday to inquire into the potentially threatening nature of some of his comments.

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | A few weeks ago, Samantha Brick penned a diatribe on the Daily Mail about how hard it is to be so beautiful and how mean jealous women are. The ever-ready-for-a-fight Internet community exploded with righteous indignation and ridicule over her fatuous narcissism. Affronted, Brick fought back, The Cutline reported.

     <title>Soldiers in Afghan Photo Scandal Need Help -- Not Courts Martial</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | I am a former combat medic in the U.S. Army. I served in many places from 1984 to 1989, and I have seen many bodies in my time as a combat medic. We never took pictures unless ordered to do so. That is the problem with this new scandal coming out of the 82nd Airborne Division in Ft. Bragg, N.C.

     <title>A Veteran's Musings on the Afghan Photo Leak</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | First, a little of my backstory: I am a U.S. Navy veteran. I spent 14 years in the service, I deeply enjoyed it, and I am very proud to call myself a veteran. While I was never personally involved in combat, I spent a lot of time overseas in support of Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Enduring Freedom, and several other joint and combined operations that never made the newspapers. I have served with, and trained, dozens of sailors who continue to serve with distinction to this day. I am proud to know them and I hope they are proud to have known me.

     <title>New Abuse Photos Mean It's Past Time America Left Afghanistan</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | For the third time in four months the United States faces a controversy involving its military and an incident Afghans will undoubtedly see as abuse. Although Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's office issued a statement that vowed all involved in the latest incident would be punished, the release of photos of American servicemen posing and handling the remains of suicide bombers and insurgents will spark yet another round of protests against the U.S. and NATO occupation forces within the war-torn country.

     <title>For this Airman, Afghanistan Atrocities Reminiscent of Vietnam</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | On 9/11, I was a senior airman in the Air Force. Two weeks later, I was on a C-5 cargo aircraft headed to the Middle East. At that time, the war in Afghanistan was about retaliation for an attack on U.S. soil that sent the country into a frenzy of fear and anger. The objective was to send a message directly to the Taliban that our country was off limits.

     <title>Pictures of Soldiers Posing with Dead Insurgents Published</title>
     <description>
      From the recent shooting deaths of 17 Afghan civilians by a soldier and the Quran burning incident that sparked violent protests throughout Afghanistan, the U.S. military has a lot of work to do in regaining the trust of the Afghan people. And now that job seems to have gotten a little bit harder as the Los Angeles Times published photos today showing soldiers posing with the bodies of dead insurgents. The Army was informed of the 2-year-old photos before they were released and is investigating. Here is some more information on this incident.

     <title>So Long, Dick Clark</title>
     <description>
      FIRST PERSON | Struggling to fit in with my classmates, I saw Dick Clark as the link to what was normal adolescent behavior. Clark, dead at 82, managed to look 27 when he was 60. But it was as host of &quot;American Bandstand&quot; that he really earned the moniker of American's Oldest Teenager with the comfort and acceptance he provided to awkward tweens like me.

     <title>Dick Clark's Influence on My Youth</title>
     <description>
      FIRST PERSON | I owe it all to Dick Clark for introducing me to popular music and dancing during my childhood and teen years. If it wasn't for him my life would have been a lot different and most likely boring. He died today, the Associated Press reports, and has left a gaping hole in pop music. Oddly enough, I can't think of a time when something Clark produced or hosted on TV wasn't on the airwaves. During my childhood and into my teens there was always &quot;American Bandstand.&quot;

     <title>Buddy Roemer: A Closer Look at the Third-Party Candidate</title>
     <description>
      It isn't very often that a third-party candidate receives a lot of attention from voters. There have been two candidates in recent memory that had a noticeable impact on presidential races as third party contenders. Ralph Nader captured a sizable number of votes in 2000, and Ross Perot presented a serious challenge in 1992. According to Yahoo! News, a group called Americans Elect is trying to change that by attempting to put a third, strong name on the ballot for the 2012 election.

     <title>Secret Service Agent, Colombian Prostitute Gamble -- And Lose</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The media is awash with a sensational story. There are government agents, slinky women, national leaders and foreign travel -- all the hallmarks of a good spy novel. Unfortunately, it's not the plot of an upcoming book or film. It's the scandal surrounding the Secret Service being involved with sex workers overseas -- and one of the women has gone on the record, according to the New York Times.

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The news of Dick Clark's death on Wednesday has been a shock to nearly everyone on the planet. For those of us who religiously watch the annual &quot;New Year's Rockin' Eve&quot; special on ABC, it is safe to say that ringing in the New Year won't be quite the same. For those who remember Clark from his former years as host of &quot;American Bandstand,&quot; it is the end of an era.

      COMMENTARY | After 14 years serving our country as an F-15 pilot in the U.S. Air Force, I can attest that war is a dirty business. I have lost very close friends and feel fortunate having survived an ejection from an aircraft. You put on your flight suit, kiss your wife, hugs your kids and wonder if that was the last time.

     <title>Afghan Corpse Photo Leak: a Plea for Context</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Imagine what it would be like if, every day and every minute, you expected someone to kill you. Think about how the stress levels would grow exponentially. You would be suspicious of everyone and everything in your immediate vicinity. Think about the impact you would feel emotionally as you watch several of your closest friends die at the hands of rogue terrorists who want you to join your friends in similar body bags. Consider how you would react if you saw your friends body being desecrated and dragged through a village square.

     <description>
      The Associated Press reports the case of missing person Brittany Killgore has taken a turn for the worse. Killgore has been missing since April 13. Jessica Lynn Lopez was arrested Tuesday near San Diego in connection with a murder case. A woman's body was found later in the day 70 miles away. Killgore, 22, is the wife of a Marine who went missing after filing for divorce. Another Marine, 45-year-old Louis Ray Perez, was arrested on a separate charge and is under investigation because he last saw Killgore alive.

     <title>Ted Nugent to NRA: &quot;Your Fault for Not Shooting Him&quot;</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | In my highly unscientific, un-DSM-IV-TR-based opinion, Ted Nugent is nuts. Not &quot;I disagree with him and I have no idea how he can take that stance so he must be crazy&quot; nuts, but &quot;I cannot believe this man is allowed to own an arsenal of weapons&quot; nuts. And yet not only does he own weapons, he was recently invited to speak to thousands of fellow guntoters at the National Rifle Association's annual meeting.
