     <title>Five Myths of the Racist' Criminal Justice System</title>
     <description>
      Calling America's criminal justice system &quot;racist&quot; is not confined to &quot;civil rights leaders&quot; like the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. Then-Sen. Barack Obama, during the 2008 presidential campaign, said it, too. Blacks and whites, said Obama, &quot;are arrested at very different rates, are convicted at very different rates (and) receive very different sentences ... for the same crime.&quot;

     <title>What Mitt Romney Seems to Believe (and Why He's so Disliked)</title>
     <description>
      With the Republican primary contest over and the general election underway, Mitt Romney faces a voting public whose disdain for him has reached levels that pollsters describe as &quot;historic.&quot; From his embittered opponents as well as from Romney and his campaign, Americans have learned that the former Massachusetts governor simply won't uphold any political position, issue or achievement he thinks might cost him votes. He doesn't seem to understand that his inconstancy forfeits more respect than any disagreeable opinion would.

     <title>NEGROES WITH GUNS</title>
     <description>
      Liberals have leapt on the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida to push for the repeal of &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws and to demand tighter gun control. (MSNBC'S Karen Finney blamed &quot;the same people who stymied gun regulation at every point.&quot;) This would be like demanding more funding for the General Services Administration after seeing how its employees blew taxpayer money on a party weekend in Las Vegas. ...

     <title>THIS ELECTION IS DOG MEAT</title>
     <description>
      The Democrats' war on women meme is failing.If you read between the lines of the April 17 poll from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, you can see it's President Obama, not Gov. Romney, who has reasons to fear a growing gender gap. (This may be why Obama disavowed the meme and slapped back Hilary Rosen's mean-girl words to Ann Romney.)The Pew poll shows Obama with a narrowing lead, 49 percent to 44 percent, down from a 12-point lead last month. ...
