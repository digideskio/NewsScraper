     <title>Bank of America Sees Real Profits Following Fake Campaign</title>
     <description>
      After getting pummeled by market forces for the better part of last year, the lights are starting to flicker back on at Bank of America. The nation's second largest lender's earnings beat analyst estimates and profit rose &quot;excluding certain line items,&quot;&nbsp;Bloomberg reports, thanks to &quot;a rebound in trading and better&nbsp;credit quality.&quot; The bank's shares jumped in early morning trading but remained basically flat after the bell. So is it good news or bad news for the company? That depends on how you read the charts.
