Helm, 71, who also toured with Ringo Starr's All Star band in the 1980s and won a Grammy Award for his 2011 release &quot;Ramble at the Ryman,&quot; had canceled a series of recent gigs, raising fears about his health. A message posted on his official website by his wife Sandy and daughter Amy, said that Helm &quot;is in the final stages of his battle with cancer. Please send your prayers and love to him as he makes his way through this part of his journey. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

But it's a whole different story when it comes to his wife Michelle and another musical icon, Beyonce. The &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; songbird published a hand-written mash note to the First Lady on her Tumblr page (via Politico) recently, calling Obama &quot;the ULTIMATE example of a truly strong African American woman. &quot;She is a caring mother, she's a loving wife, while at the same time, she is the FIRST LADY!!!!!,&quot; Beyonce's gush-fest continued. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - Several of the music industry's largest trade groups on Wednesday reached an agreement on royalty rates for licensing music to online music services like iTunes Match. Ever since the dawn of digital music, the industry has not only had to grapple with how to control the illegal spread of its content - curbing piracy - but also how to properly charge for its distribution on legal services. It is of growing importance now that more than 50 percent of the music market's value comes from digital sales. That is what this agreement tries to resolve. ...
