     <title>Cost of Green Products Makes Shoppers See Red</title>
     <description>
      Earth Day has a long way to go before it convinces consumers to put their money where their mouth is and pay more for eco-friendly green products, a new study shows. Though nearly half of people surveyed (46 percent) said they were more inclined to buy a product if it is eco-friendly, the majority (59 percent) said they were unwilling to pay more money for that product of service. Green products may be good at generating lip service, but they’re not so good at opening wallets.

     <title>Are Best Friends Forever? Not For Women</title>
     <description>
      Best friends aren't forever, at least if phone records are any indication. A woman's No. 1 contact during her 20s is most often a male, but by age 45, she'll most likely be calling another woman — probably her daughter — more than anyone else, a new study finds.

It has hired Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse to help explore strategic alternatives, including a possible sale. GSK has been invited to participate in that process. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
