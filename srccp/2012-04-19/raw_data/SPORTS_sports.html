Moyer, who made his major league debut in 1986, threw seven innings and allowed two runs to reach the milestone. At 49 years and 150 days old, Moyer surpassed Jack Quinn of the former Brooklyn Dodgers, who previously set the mark for oldest winner at 49 years and 70 days in 1932. &quot;For me to put that in front of the game really would be unfair to my team mates, unfair to myself,&quot; the humble left-hander told reporters. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Moyer, who made his major league debut in 1986, threw seven innings and allowed two runs to reach the milestone. At 49 years and 150 days old, Moyer surpassed Jack Quinn of the former Brooklyn Dodgers, who previously set the mark for oldest winner at 49 years and 70 days in 1932. &quot;For me to put that in front of the game really would be unfair to my team mates, unfair to myself,&quot; the humble left-hander told reporters. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
