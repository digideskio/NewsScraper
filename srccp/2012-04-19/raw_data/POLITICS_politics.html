     <description>
      ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish police hauled in a top retired general along with several fellow officers for questioning on Thursday over their role in the overthrow of Turkey's first Islamist government in 1997, the latest affront to the once-supreme military. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party, AKP, which itself has Islamist roots, has made curbing the military's political influence one of its main missions, and state prosecutors have pursued officers suspected of conspiring against current and former governments. ...

      BEIRUT (Reuters) - Four military transport planes flew over the Mediterranean into Beirut this week from bases in Brindisi and Prague, carrying the first hardware for a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Syria whose ultimate outcome is unforeseeable. How and when the operation might end is a question the world body may have to grapple with for some time. The planes' cargo of 10 4x4s in the white paintwork of the United Nations, familiar on former battlefields the world over, was destined for an unarmed contingent of 30 ceasefire monitors which will expand over the coming weeks to 300 observers. ...

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. trade panel approved anti-dumping duties on steel nails from the United Arab Emirates and optical brightening agents from China and Taiwan on Thursday.

The two cases were among a group of five filed over of the course of two days last year. Earlier this week, the ITC rejected duties on refrigerators from South Korea and Mexico and steel wheels from China. ...

     <title>Lawmakers press UK government over China murder scandal</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Lawmakers asked the British government on Thursday about rumors that a businessman whose murder sparked political upheaval in China may have been a spy and demanded to know why it took so long for ministers to be told of suspicions about his death. Police in China initially attributed the death of Neil Heywood, 41, in a hotel room in the southwest Chinese city of Chongqing last November to cardiac arrest due to over-consumption of alcohol. ...

     <title>Nigeria fuel subsidy graft cost $6.8 billion: parliament</title>
     <description>
      ABUJA (Reuters) - Mismanagement and theft by top Nigerian officials involved in a corrupt fuel subsidy scheme cost the country $6.8 billion in three years, a parliamentary probe found, calling on President Goodluck Jonathan to overhaul the state oil firm and ministry. Nigeria tried in vain to end gasoline subsidies on January 1, but a week of public protests forced the government to partially re-instate the payments, seen as a massive drain on its budget. The report filed late on Wednesday said the state oil firm, private marketers and the regulator owe a combined 1.07 trillion naira ($6. ...

     <title>U.N. chief says South Sudan infringing on Sudan sovereignty</title>
     <description>
      UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Thursday that South Sudan's seizure of an oil field in neighboring Sudan was an &quot;illegal act&quot; and called on both countries to stop fighting. Clashes along the ill-defined border between the former civil war foes has led to a standoff over the Heglig oil field after it was seized last week by troops from South Sudan, which declared independence last year. &quot;I call on South Sudan to immediately withdraw its forces from Heglig. This is an infringement on the sovereignty of Sudan and a clearly illegal act,&quot; Ban told reporters. ...

Senate Republicans are chiding the White House for failing to renominate Svinicki, who publicly complained that the panel’s Democratic chairman was an intimidating bully. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky denounced the “curious lack of action’’ on Svinicki’s reappointment to the NRC and called further delay unacceptable.
