     <title>HIV-positive man fights charge that saliva was deadly</title>

The Court of Appeals, New York's top court, will hear Plunkett's case on Thursday. ...

     <description>

Insurers have valued the paintings at about $144,000 combined. The ministry said the replicas appeared to be 5-10 years old. ...
