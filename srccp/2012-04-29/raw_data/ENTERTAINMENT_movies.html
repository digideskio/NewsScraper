In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, the director acknowledged that some did not care for the look of the film at the rate of 48 frames per second, rather than the standard 24. &quot;I can't say anything, just like I can't say anything to someone who doesn't like fish,&quot; he said. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
