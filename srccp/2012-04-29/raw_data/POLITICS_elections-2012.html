     <title>Millennial voters: Obama gaining, but Romney has an opening</title>
     <description>
      President Obama now leads Mitt Romney by 17 percentage points – 43 percent to 26 percent – among voters ages 18 to 29, according to a poll released Tuesday by Harvard’s Institute of Politics (IOP). That margin represents a 6-point gain from the last survey of so-called Millennial voters by the IOP in November.

     <title>N2K Presidential Race: Is Obama Alienating His Wealthy Base?</title>
     <description>
      It’s easy to forget now that President Obama is preaching a populist message on the campaign trail, but a major part of his winning coalition in 2008 was from wealthy voters--the very top “1 percent” whom he calls upon to pay their fair share in taxes.

     <title>Analysis: Sarkozy's odds improve but remain against him</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Strong support for far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the first round of France's presidential election has lifted Nicolas Sarkozy's hopes of clinching a second term, but he will struggle to win over enough of her voters to keep him in power. Surveys show fewer National Front voters will rally behind the conservative Sarkozy in a runoff vote than did in the 2007 election, and as he shifts further rightwards on immigration and Europe he risks alienating the centrist voters he also needs.

     <title>Poll: France's Sarkozy seen losing 2012 election</title>
     <description>
      PARIS (Reuters) - Socialist candidate Francois Hollande came out ahead in the first round of France's presidential election on April 22 and will face runner-up President Nicolas Sarkozy in the deciding round on May 6. After scoring 28.63 percent to Sarkozy's 27.18 percent in round one, Hollande looks set to win the final contest. But much will depend on which way far right National Front voters choose to swing after their record 18 percent showing in the first round made them potential kingmakers. ...
