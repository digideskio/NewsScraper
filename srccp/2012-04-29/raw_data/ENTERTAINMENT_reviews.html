      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Pirates are right up there with vampires, werewolves and people saying &quot;LOL&quot; out loud on the list of Played-Out Pop Culture Phenomena, but leave it to the folks at Aardman Animation to find the remaining reservoirs of fun in a bunch of seafaring scalawags. Whether you're besotted with peglegs or sick to death of skulls and crossbones, there's a good chance you'll find yourself enchanted by &quot;The Pirates! Band of Misfits. ...

     <title>Writer worked to make vampires scary again</title>
     <description>
      TOKYO (Reuters) - What with romance and suave, sensitive characters, vampires weren't scary enough for author David Wellington anymore. So he decided to see if he could bring some terror back to tales about the centuries-old undead creatures. The result was five books starring policewoman Laura Caxton and Justinia Malvern, the ancient vampire she fights, climaxing in the just-released &quot;32 Fangs&quot; - a chilling, sometimes graphic tale of their final, epic battle. ...

     <title>Book reveals hidden horror of N.Korean labor camps</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - &quot;Escape From Camp 14&quot; makes for grim reading. Journalist Blaine Harden's account of a young man's life in and escape from a labor camp in secretive North Korea has drawn parallels with the Soviet gulags and Nazi Holocaust. One big difference is that North Korea's political prison camps, holding an estimated 200,000 people and handing out their own brand of extreme cruelty, are still operating. The story of Shin Dong-hyuk combines a thrilling and unique tale of escape with a harrowing memoir of Camp 14, which lies to the northeast of the capital Pyongyang. ...

     <title>&quot;Chimpanzee&quot; presents sanitized jungle</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Chimpanzees eat monkeys. That's one of the big takeaways from &quot;Chimpanzee,&quot; the latest in the DisneyNature series of documentaries. We don't get to see this happen in a way that would jeopardize the movie's G rating, of course, but between description (by narrator Tim Allen) and implication, we get the general idea. And while that's certainly educational — it's the first thing that's going to come to my mind next time I need to distinguish between the two animals — the movie's coyness about portraying that fact of life pinpoints the general problem with &quot;Chimpanzee. ...

These are just a few of the lives chronicled by author Palash Krishna Mehrotra in his non-fictional account of the changes that have swept over India over the last three decades, specifically how the lives of its youth have changed. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Marcel Beyer's latest novel takes place in postwar Dresden, but the award-winning German author didn't actually set foot there until the mid-1990s. When he did, he knew &quot;from the very first day&quot; that he had a book to write. That book is &quot;Kaltenburg.&quot; Originally published in Germany several years ago, it was released in the United States on Tuesday and is Beyer's latest book to be translated into English by the writer who the New Yorker magazine designated as one of the current best young European novelists. ...

All survived. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
