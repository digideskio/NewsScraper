The findings, reported in the journal Diabetes Care, do not prove that eating your fruits and veggies will ward off type 2 diabetes -- a disease closely associated with obesity and old age. But researchers say the findings should give people yet more incentive to eat the way our mothers always told us. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong on Thursday suspended imports of poultry products, including eggs and frozen meat, from China's northeastern Liaoning province for 21 days after the authorities there confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu.

     <title>U.S. delays decision on Takeda diabetes drug</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said U.S. regulators had extended their review of its diabetes drug alogliptin, requesting additional data on what the company hopes will be the successor to its top-selling Actos drug. Shares of Takeda fell as much as 2 percent after Japan's biggest drugmaker announced during Tokyo trading on Thursday that it had received the request from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Actos lost patent protection in 2011, and generic versions are expected to hit the market later this year. ...

     <title>What is Mad Cow Disease?</title>
     <description>
      Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE, attacks a cow's nervous system and causes the animal's brain to swell - like a sponge. This slow-growing disease is fatal for cattle but it indirectly affects a small percentage of humans that consume them. People do not &quot;catch&quot; mad cow disease; instead the disease evolves into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
