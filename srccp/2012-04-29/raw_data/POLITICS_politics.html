The black-tie dinner, informally billed as the &quot;nerd prom,&quot; is the biggest social event of the year for Washington media and gives presidents a chance to show a lighter side. &quot;I'm not going to attack any of the Republican candidates. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

In advanced countries, especially in Europe, employment is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels of 2008 until the end of 2016 -- two years later than it previously predicted -- in line with a slowdown in production.

     <description>
      BEIRUT (Reuters) - Militants fired rocket-propelled grenades at the Central Bank building in Damascus and also attacked a police patrol in the capital, wounding four police, state television said on Monday. It said the attack on the Central Bank by &quot;an armed terrorist group&quot; caused only slight damage, and security forces were chasing the attackers of the police patrol. Activists in the capital reported hearing several explosions and gunfire. (Editing by Stacey Joyce)

      JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Supreme Court postponed the razing of five unauthorized buildings in the West Bank on Sunday, a ruling that gave the government more time to argue against their demolition and placate pro-settler political partners. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government agreed last year to remove the apartment blocks on the edge of the Beit El settlement, after a court ruled they were built on private Palestinian land. ...

     <title>Libya's Gaddafi-era oil chief found floating dead in Danube</title>
     <description>
      VIENNA (Reuters) - Libya's former top oil industry official, Shokri Ghanem, has been found floating dead in the River Danube in Austria, police said on Sunday. Ghanem, 69, had been chairman of Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC) before defecting last year several months after opponents of Muammar Gaddafi had risen up against the Libyan leader and begun a rebellion. As NOC chairman since 2006, Ghanem helped steer Libya's oil policy and held the high-profile job of representing Libya at OPEC meetings, often visiting Vienna for meetings in that role. ...

      BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's IG Metall union plans more partial walk-outs on Wednesday after about 2,500 workers walked off the job in Berlin, Bavaria and in several other states early on Sunday to back their demand for a 6.5 percent wage increase. The engineering sector employers have offered a 3-percent pay rise for a period of 14 months for the 3.6 million workers in the sector, which the union has rejected. The union said it planned token strikes in North Rhine-Westphalia on Wednesday, targeting a Daimler plant in Duesseldorf. ...
