     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New Jersey school district has fired at least two educators for verbally abusing autistic children after a father sent his 10-year-old autistic son to school wearing a hidden microphone upon suspecting he was being mistreated by staff.

     <title>Why Retirement Saving Trumps College Tuition</title>
     <description>
      Many parents give their children financial support to attend college.

     <title>Obama Courts Young Voters with Student Loan Battle</title>
     <description>
      President Barack Obama is attempting to win favor with younger voters by championing the affordability of higher education, according to the Associated Press. Obama focused on the issue of student loans during his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday. He asked Congress to extend a law that will keep rates for one of the federal student loan programs at its current low for the time being. Without the extension, many federal student loan rates are set to double after July 1.
