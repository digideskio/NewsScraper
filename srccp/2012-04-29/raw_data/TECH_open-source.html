     <title>Study: Kindle Fire Leads the Android Pack</title>
     <description>
      Analytics firm comScore uses &quot;census-level information from tagged web page content&quot; to see how many people visit what web pages, how often, using which devices. The firm recently shared some of its findings as they pertain to tablets and smartphones, in a news release posted Thursday. The report deliberately overlooks Apple's iPad, which has sold tens of millions of units and dominates the whole &quot;tablet market,&quot; in order to focus on the competition between manufacturers who build devices powered by Google's open-source Android operating system.
