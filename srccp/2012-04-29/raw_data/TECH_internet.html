The agreement, to take effect on July 1 for Texas' 6.25-percent sales tax, follows another accord reached with Nevada earlier in the week to begin collecting that state's 8.1 percent sales tax on January 1, 2014.

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street's most bullish expectations after the world's largest Internet retailer brought costs under control, sending its shares almost 10 percent higher.
