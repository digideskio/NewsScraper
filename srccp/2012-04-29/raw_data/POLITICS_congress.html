     <title>Objections to Domestic Violence Bill Show Congress Needs Change</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Senate passed a bill renewing the Violence Against Women Act, a 17-year-old measure designed to protect victims of domestic violence and allow law-enforcement agencies to act swiftly to assist them, according to CNN. Many Senate Republicans were resistant to the bill, citing inclusion of new language. This new language would, among other things, extend protection to victims of domestic violence in same-gender relationships.
