The combined wealth of Britain's 1,000 richest people swelled by almost five percent to more than 414 billion pounds ($670 billion), the highest recorded by the 24-year-old survey, the Sunday Times newspaper said in an advance release on Saturday.

     <description>
      FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German unit of UniCredit SpA has seen a strong first quarter, its Chief Financial officer told a German paper. &quot;The first quarter went well,&quot; HypoVereinsbank CFO Peter Hofbauer told daily Boersenzeitung's Saturday edition. &quot;But it is usually like that at the start of the year. It would be wrong to extrapolate that for the whole year,&quot; he told the paper. Unicredit is set to report first quarter earnings on May 10. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Friday and posted their best weekly gains in a month as stronger-than-expected earnings from Amazon.com and Expedia Inc reinforced confidence in corporate performance. Wall Street managed a fourth day of gains as the strong earnings season outweighed a surprisingly weak reading on first-quarter economic growth. Online retailer Amazon climbed 15.7 percent to $226.85 and contributed half of Nasdaq's gain for the day. An S&amp;P retail index rose 3.5 percent and hit an all-time high. Shares of Expedia, the Web-based travel provider, surged 23. ...
