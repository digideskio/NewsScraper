     <title>Canada to offer more insight on blocked deals</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - The Canadian government said on Friday it intends to make its reviews of foreign takeovers more transparent, by stating when it has reservations about a deal and perhaps even going so far as to provide details about its concerns. The move comes as a nod to those who have complained about opaque rules that allow the government to block takeovers that it does not think will provide a &quot;net benefit&quot; to Canada. ...

     <title>TransCanada profit falls; eyes new oil pipeline</title>
     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp reported a 14 percent drop in quarterly profit on Friday as the natural gas-transport segment of the country's biggest pipeline company was hurt by the depressed state of North America's gas industry. Chief Executive Russ Girling said the company is looking at several regulatory and operational measures to deal with pressures on its Canadian gas mainline after an unusually warm winter slashed demand for the fuel, cutting volume on the system to less than half its roughly 6 billion cubic foot a day capacity. ...

     <title>Canada seeks C$900 million or more in spectrum auction</title>
     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada aims to raise a minimum of nearly C$900 million through an auction of valuable wireless spectrum, based on ground rules published by the government this week, though the sale could bring in far more as carriers vie for the frequencies. The online document spelling out the rules marks the start of a months-long consultation process that will bed down the finer points of an auction that will shape the wireless industry for years to come. The sale is scheduled for early next year. ...

      (Reuters) - One of Canada's largest pension plans teamed up on Thursday with Japan's pension funds and some of its major conglomerates to help raise $20 billion for the world's largest infrastructure fund to invest in assets such as roads and airports. While a handful of the world's biggest pension funds have the capacity to lead their own investments in infrastructure assets, the initiative represents an unprecedented effort to cut out asset managers as middle men in infrastructure investment. ...

      OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - The end of a long legal battle over whether Globalive's foreign backing precluded it from offering wireless service in Canada opens the door for the company to amass more foreign cash ahead of an auction of airwaves next year, its chief executive said. Canada's Supreme Court declined on Thursday to hear a challenge to a government decision to allow Globalive to operate in Canada despite close ties to a foreign company, initially Egypt's Orascom Telecom Holding SAE but now Russia's Vimpelcom Ltd. ...

     <title>Brent crude edges down towards $119 on slower U.S. growth</title>
     <description>
      SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brent crude edged lower towards $119 per barrel on Monday as economic woes in developed economies stoked fears of lower fuel demand, although the prospect of a third round of monetary easing by the United States limited its decline. Economic growth cooled in the first quarter, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve could start a third round of government bond buying, or quantitative easing known in markets as QE3, to support the economy. Such a move would increase market liquidity and heighten risk appetite for commodities. ...

     <title>WTC claims NYC height record, but experts likely to disagree on ranking among world's tallest</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK, N.Y. - One World Trade Center, the giant monolith being built to replace the twin towers destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks, will lay claim to the title of New York City's tallest skyscraper on Monday. Workers will erect steel columns that will make its unfinished skeleton a little over 1,250 feet high, just enough to peak over the roof of the observation deck on the Empire State Building.
