     <title>Israel court puts 60-day hold on settlement razings</title>
     <description>
      JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Supreme Court postponed the razing of five unauthorized buildings in the West Bank on Sunday, a ruling that gave the government more time to argue against their demolition and placate pro-settler political partners. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government agreed last year to remove the apartment blocks on the edge of the Beit El settlement, after a court ruled they were built on private Palestinian land. ...

     <title>Legislators talk about get-tough immigration laws</title>
     <description>
      The U.S. Supreme Court is considering the fate of Arizona's get-tough immigration law. If key parts of it are upheld, other states may be urged to follow suit. Some thoughts from lawmakers across the country:

     <title>PUNITIVE IMMIGRATION LAWS SEEM LIKELY TO EXPAND</title>
     <description>
      The U.S. Supreme Court seems inclined to back at least a portion of Arizona's xenophobic immigration law, which countenances racial profiling. Even Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a member of the court's liberal wing and its first Hispanic, signaled to the Obama administration, which has opposed the law, that its arguments were &quot;not selling very well,&quot; according to The New York Times.That's too bad. Several states that rushed to copy Arizona's terrible example, including Georgia and Alabama, need to be rescued from their bigotry. ...

     <title>President Obama Should Applaud Arizona Illegal Immigrant Law</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | President Barack Obama might wear a smile on his face during campaign speeches, but anger over Arizona's immigration law is likely causing frowns behind closed doors. Fear of a liberal agenda setback when the Supreme Court rules on the matter could mean a drop in the polls. Misguided progressives who consider responsible reform an attempt at voter suppression will likely be equally unhappy when the court rules in favor of the responsible law.

Now comes the nationwide angst of waiting - as long as two months - for decisions, particularly the one that will resolve the most high-stakes and closely watched case of the year: the challenge to the Obama-sponsored healthcare law. The collective impatience is fueling a mini-industry of rumors, wagers and speculation not seen since the Bush v.

     <title>U.S. finds discrimination in Memphis juvenile courts</title>
     <description>
      NASHVILLE, Tenn (Reuters) - Black youths arrested in Memphis, Tennessee, were much more likely than white juveniles to be jailed and tried as adults, discriminatory practices that also affect Hispanic youths in other cities, the Justice Department said on Thursday. A review of 66,000 juvenile court cases in Memphis, where numerous abuses drew Justice Department investigators in 2009, revealed &quot;serious and systemic failures&quot; in the way youthful offenders were treated, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said. ...

     <title>Determining Immigration Status Will Be Difficult for Arizona</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to Reuters, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor -- the only Hispanic justice on the court -- was very active in Wednesday's oral arguments regarding the case of whether Arizona can enforce its illegal immigration law. And she made a very good point: It will be difficult to determine whether someone is an illegal immigrant or not. The difficulty is caused by lapses in the federal system. And it could cause people to end up waiting in jail for the government to determine their status.

     <title>What Will Happen If the Supreme Court Backs Arizona on Immigration?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Illegal immigration is a complicated issue that doesn't seem to have a perfect solution, but the controversial Arizona immigration law is not the right answer. According to the Associated Press, the Supreme Court may &quot;follow through on its suggestion that it would let local police enforce the most controversial part&quot; of the law.

     <title>Arizona Has Solid Argument in Supreme Court Immigration Case</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to Reuters, Arizona argued before the Supreme Court that its controversial use of state and local law enforcement to police suspected illegal immigration through citizenship checks during routine traffic stops is Constitutional. Several of the points of contention brought up by Arizona and the federal government are valid. Given the arguments, immigration could become the next potent states' rights issue.
