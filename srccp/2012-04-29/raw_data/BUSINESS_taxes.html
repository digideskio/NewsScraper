     <title>U.S. lawmakers defend slew of corporate tax breaks</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If a congressional hearing on Thursday is any indication, U.S. lawmakers will have a hard time breaking the stand-off over where to trim the fat in the federal tax code. Nearly every lawmaker who testified at a panel on the individual merits of $35 billion in tax breaks came out in favor of making their pet provisions permanent. Tax breaks - ranging from a popular corporate research credit to a subsidy for Puerto Rico that critics say benefits big rum producers - were the topic before a tax-writing subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives. ...

     <title>Powerful but obscure Tax Court lags on access</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Unless you are a tax lawyer, the granite building with bronze-tinted windows that looms over Washington's I-395 freeway may be the most influential courthouse you've never heard of. The U.S. Tax Court is a powerful but obscure institution that has been opening itself up to the public, but only very slowly, and it still lags behind other courts on access. The court hears cases that range from warring spouses to high-stakes challenges by major corporations to the practices of the tax-collecting U.S. Internal Revenue Service. ...

     <title>Complaint tests conservative group's charity status</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A conservative group that promotes legislation in state capitals is mainly a lobbying organization and should not benefit from a special tax status meant for charities, a liberal group says in a complaint to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The complaint, released on Monday, challenges the tax-law status of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) as a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) charity. That status lets ALEC avoid paying taxes and lets its supporters deduct their contributions. ...

     <title>IRS rule threatens bank capital flight: analysts</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Banks in Texas, Florida and other southern states could face a pull-out of non-U.S. depositors due to a new U.S. rule finalized on Tuesday, industry analysts said. The rule issued by the Internal Revenue Service will require U.S. banks, starting on January 1, 2013, to report to the IRS payments of interest made to non-resident aliens. &quot;The reporting required by these regulations is essential to the U.S. government's efforts to combat offshore tax evasion,&quot; said an IRS statement announcing the rules' finalization. ...

     <title>First Person: I Was on the Hook for $2,500</title>
     <description>
      I had a horrible closing as a real estate attorney in my first year of self-employment in 2006. I did a purchase closing where the seller was represented by a real estate agent that we trusted and had done a lot of closings before. When we did the title search, we found a federal tax lien against the seller. We brought this to the attention of the agent; &quot;magically&quot;, she procured a satisfaction of the tax lien. We carried on with the closing and everything seemed fine.

     <title>First Person: My $139,000 Tax Bill</title>
     <description>
      In March 2007, I submitted my income information to my tax planner. During 2006, I had tinkered with day trading stocks and had made a small ($2,000-$3,000) profit on sales of over a million dollars. I received my tax documents back and was overjoyed to note that I only owed the Internal Revenue Service around $200 and the Commonwealth of Virginia even less. I promptly mailed my tax forms to the appropriate agencies and forgot about the matter.
