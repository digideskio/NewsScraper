     <title>How the L.A. Riots Made California a Blue State</title>
     <description>
      ANALYSIS | It's hard to believe this, but long before the Los Angeles Riots 20 years ago, California was Republican territory. But the factors leading up to the Rodney King case, as well as the national government's fumbled response to the crisis, pushed the state into the Democratic column for the last five elections, and possibly a sixth.

     <title>Romney Should Tell Santorum to Keep His Endorsement</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The media made a big deal out of recent presidential race drop-out Rick Santorum's qualified endorsement of rival Mitt Romney on CNN's &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot; this week. He adamantly refused to endorse Romney as a candidate until the Republican National Convention. But Romney should not worry overly much if Santorum ever endorses him, which he grudgingly said he would do once Romney was the GOP nominee. ...

     <title>Romney Campaign Manager Attacks Obama's Record</title>
     <description>
      Mitt Romney's campaign manager Matt Rhoades issued a memo detailing what his camp asserts are the multitude of failings of President Barack Obama. The memo, which likened the president's campaign to &quot;intermittent lawn sprinklers, spewing out attacks in seemingly random directions,&quot; referenced the victory speech Romney gave after Tuesday's primaries.

     <title>GOP Convention: Guns Are Great Until They're Not</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | You can say what you want about the Second Amendment, about what it guarantees, about what is meant by those pesky first 13 words, but it's impossible to deal separately with the theory and reality of guns. If you do, you end up with the problem facing Tampa, Fla., the host city to the Republican National Convention, as reported by Raw Story.

     <title>Talk of Edwards Sex Tape Should Be Allowed in Court</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Normally, I would say a video tape of sex between two consenting adults is something that should be kept private. That the public has neither the legal right to view such a thing without the consent of both parties or even have the tape be part of the discussion in sworn testimony. Given that the stars of the tape -- former presidential candidate John Edwards and his mistress Rielle Hunter have children -- normally that would make my convictions on such matters even stronger. ...

     <title>President Obama Veto Threat Proves Rare</title>
     <description>
      The House approved a measure keeping student loan interest rates at 3.4 percent. The bill would keep interest rates low beyond July 1 when the rates are set to double. The House vote was 215-195 and the bill moves to the Senate. President Barack Obama has threatened to veto the bill if it reaches his desk, even after touting lower student loan rates in recent speeches. His reasoning is Republicans sought to finance the bill by removing funding for Prevention and Public Health Fund in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Obama's veto threat is a rare tactic for the 44th president.

     <title>President Obama Should Applaud Arizona Illegal Immigrant Law</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | President Barack Obama might wear a smile on his face during campaign speeches, but anger over Arizona's immigration law is likely causing frowns behind closed doors. Fear of a liberal agenda setback when the Supreme Court rules on the matter could mean a drop in the polls. Misguided progressives who consider responsible reform an attempt at voter suppression will likely be equally unhappy when the court rules in favor of the responsible law.

     <title>Atheist Attacks on Community Landmarks Are Disgraceful</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Atheists do not like crosses on public spaces and often disrupt communities to force removal of the symbols. Occasional headlines prompted by atheist protests are not uncommon. A flurry of atheist activity illustrates an alarming trend of attacks on long-standing landmarks. Crosses positioned on public land are no more intrusive than the &quot;In God We Trust&quot; found on American currency. It is past time for the political correctness pendulum to swing back into a position of reasonableness.

     <title>Obama's Threatened Student Loan Veto is Election Year Politics</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Even the question of how to reduce the burden of student loans has become a political hot potato. On Friday, President Barack Obama threatened to veto a bill passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives because it would tap into a special reserve fund that the president does not want to use.

     <title>Republic Wireless Sending Out Invitations for Unlimited Data</title>
     <description>
      Republic Wireless is a small startup that drew a lot of attention last year when it offered a $19 per month &quot;unlimited&quot; prepaid data plan. At the time, the plan was not truly unlimited because it came with the caveat that if you used too many minutes or megabytes you would be asked to cut down or leave altogether. That restriction has since been lifted; Republic Wireless' plans are now truly unlimited, and offer all-you-can-eat data, texting and voice minutes for $19 a month.

     <title>Objections to Domestic Violence Bill Show Congress Needs Change</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Senate passed a bill renewing the Violence Against Women Act, a 17-year-old measure designed to protect victims of domestic violence and allow law-enforcement agencies to act swiftly to assist them, according to CNN. Many Senate Republicans were resistant to the bill, citing inclusion of new language. This new language would, among other things, extend protection to victims of domestic violence in same-gender relationships.

     <title>Obama's Class Warfare Tactics Divide Americans</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Renowned social policy expert Charles Murray recently shared some intriguing observations during a Reason TV interview. Murray is not afraid of tough questions, he begs for them. The libertarian author aptly detailed the crushing impact the change in cultural norms since the 1960s has had on the economy and overall quality of life. Murray's interview statement &quot;nonjudgementalism has run amok&quot; addresses the politically correct mindset that prompted increased spending on failed entitlement programs.

     <title>Federal Law Enforcement Needs Examination</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to Time, the Transportation Security Administration faces a scandal as four screeners at Los Angeles International Airport are charged with conspiring to transport narcotics. This is another blow to the beleaguered reputation of the TSA, which is frequently lambasted for unpopular security measures and the seemingly ludicrous airport security searches of children and the elderly. Other charges have included groping at security checkpoints, sexism and racism among the ranks of Air Marshals, and theft from luggage by TSA screeners.

     <title>What was John Edwardsâ€™ Real Crime?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | In colonial America you had to wear a scarlet A. Today you can be stoned to death in some countries. Adultery has long been frowned upon by moral people, but only in the media culture of modern America does a man like John Edwards get charged with a felony for misusing campaign contributions when his real crime was lying to his family and fellow citizens.

     <title>Romney Silence on Fair Pay for Women Insulting to Everyone</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | One would think that after all the distracting nonsense in the media about whether stay-at-home moms deserve credit for the unending work they do, there is more proof the real &quot;war on women&quot; is still underway from the right. It came in the form of silence from the Mitt Romney camp. But that silence said volumes, according to Lilly Ledbetter, the women's equality activist for whom the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 was named.

     <title>Sex Tape Testimony Can Be Used at John Edwards Trial</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The John Edwards corruption trial is sounding more like a soap opera, or some sleazy dime-store romance novel. All the components are there: An unfaithful presidential candidate with a dying spouse; having an affair with a staffer who gets pregnant with a secret &quot;love child;&quot; and all the drama of trying to cover it all up and keep it from the public.

      COMMENTARY | Norwegians turned out in force this week to vex admitted mass killer Anders Behring Breivik. Breivik, whose trial began last week, killed 77 people, mostly teenagers, last summer in Norway. A large crowd gathered to sing a popular children's song that Breivik claimed was responsible for brainwashing Norwegians.

     <title>Study: Kindle Fire Leads the Android Pack</title>
     <description>
      Analytics firm comScore uses &quot;census-level information from tagged web page content&quot; to see how many people visit what web pages, how often, using which devices. The firm recently shared some of its findings as they pertain to tablets and smartphones, in a news release posted Thursday. The report deliberately overlooks Apple's iPad, which has sold tens of millions of units and dominates the whole &quot;tablet market,&quot; in order to focus on the competition between manufacturers who build devices powered by Google's open-source Android operating system.

      COMMENTARY| While it seems women's rights have been under attack recently in the U.S., we have to admit that compared to other countries, females have it pretty good.

     <description>
      Recipients of student loans can breathe a little easier today as the house voted to keep interest rates low on government-sponsored Stafford loans.
