      SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Foreign companies doing business in China must navigate a business culture in which bribery is rife, finding ways to remove obstacles to expanding in the world's second-largest economy without running afoul of local or home-country laws.

Businesses added 40,000 new jobs, a step back from the 75,000 positions created in March, according to Intuit, a payrolls processing firm.

Bank lending in the city-state was S$432.6 billion ($349.29 billion) last month, up from S$426.4 billion in February. Bank lending rose 26 percent in March from a year earlier. Housing loans to consumers rose to S$134.8 billion in March from S$133.8 billion in February. Singapore banks have seen strong loan growth in recent months, helped by market share gains in areas such as trade finance as European banks reduce their emerging markets exposure. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Bank lending in the city-state was S$432.6 billion ($349.29 billion) last month, up from S$426.4 billion in February. Bank lending rose 26 percent in March from a year earlier. Housing loans to consumers rose to S$134.8 billion in March from S$133.8 billion in February. Singapore banks have seen strong loan growth in recent months, helped by market share gains in areas such as trade finance as European banks reduce their emerging markets exposure. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>No end in sight to global jobs crisis, ILO says</title>
     <description>
      GENEVA (Reuters) - Fiscal austerity and tough labor reforms have failed to create jobs, leading to an &quot;alarming&quot; situation in the global employment market that shows no sign of recovering, the International Labour Organization said on Sunday. In advanced countries, especially in Europe, employment is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels of 2008 until the end of 2016 -- two years later than it previously predicted -- in line with a slowdown in production. ...

     <description>
      BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's IG Metall union plans more partial walk-outs on Wednesday after about 2,500 workers walked off the job in Berlin, Bavaria and in several other states early on Sunday to back their demand for a 6.5 percent wage increase. The engineering sector employers have offered a 3-percent pay rise for a period of 14 months for the 3.6 million workers in the sector, which the union has rejected. The union said it planned token strikes in North Rhine-Westphalia on Wednesday, targeting a Daimler plant in Duesseldorf. ...

      MILAN (Reuters) - Italian confectionery group Ferrero has agreed to set aside $3 million to settle a class-action lawsuit championed by a Californian mother after she discovered the group's Nutella chocolate spread packed more calories than jam or syrup. Notices of class action settlements said that Ferrero USA Inc., the group's U.S. division, would pay up to $4 for every jar of Nutella bought in California since August 2009, or bought anywhere else in the United States since January 2008. The notices posted on nutellaclassactionsettlement.com said the settlement was for $3,050,000 in total. ...

      DUBAI (Reuters) - Islamic finance may face its biggest shake-up in years as a top standard-setting body seeks to reform the way the industry does business, including the role of highly paid scholars in enforcing religious principles. Khaled Al Fakih, the new secretary-general of the Bahrain-based Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), outlined plans for a sweeping review of its guidelines in an interview with Reuters. Some of AAOIFI's reforms may prove controversial by challenging entrenched interests in the fast-growing business. ...

      LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron has denied favoring Rupert Murdoch's business interests in exchange for political support from his newspaper empire, and defended a minister's handling of an ill-fated takeover bid involving the media magnate. Cameron is on the back foot ahead of local elections across much of Britain on Thursday. After a month of bad headlines about Murdoch, the budget and the return of the economy to recession, an opinion poll registered support for his Conservative Party at its lowest since 2004. ...

If realized, the deal would revive a 35-year capital alliance that was scrapped during GM's 2006 restructuring. It may also prompt Toyota Motor Corp to sell its 5.9 percent stake in the Japanese truck maker because the GM link-up would compete with its own established markets in Asia. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

If realized, the deal would revive a 35-year capital alliance that was scrapped during GM's 2006 restructuring. It may also prompt Toyota Motor Corp to sell its 5.9 percent stake in the Japanese truck maker because the GM link-up would compete with its own established markets in Asia. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
