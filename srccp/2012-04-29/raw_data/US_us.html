The van was traveling on the Bronx River Parkway when it lost control, hit the median and crossed back over two lanes of traffic before bouncing over the guardrail, officials said. The vehicle came to rest upside down in an brush-covered area below the parkway that is used by the zoo to store its monorail trains, police said. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Around the world, many anticipated the United States would behave very differently under the new leader. They wanted to hear less about Americans swaggering and throwing their weight around. Some, perhaps, wanted more talk of U.S.-style freedom and democracy, but not if it meant Washington imposing its will. Few dispute that Obama's election brought with it a noticeable change in tone. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The tent was set up as a beer garden at Kilroy's Sports Bar about a block from Busch Stadium, home to the Cardinals. Bruns said others were being treated for less serious injuries. ...

On a mostly party-line vote of 215-195, the House sent the measure to the Senate where Obama's Democrats are certain to reject it. Like Obama, they want to renew the low rate, but favor covering the one-year, $6 billion cost by ending a tax break for the rich. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

On a mostly party-line vote of 215-195, the House sent the measure to the Senate where Obama's Democrats are certain to reject it.

Around the world, many anticipated the United States would behave very differently under the new leader. They wanted to hear less about Americans swaggering and throwing their weight around. Some, perhaps, wanted more talk of U.S.-style freedom and democracy, but not if it meant Washington imposing its will. Few dispute that Obama's election brought with it a noticeable change in tone. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Around the world, many anticipated the United States would behave very differently under the new leader. They wanted to hear less about Americans swaggering and throwing their weight around. Some, perhaps, wanted more talk of U.S.-style freedom and democracy, but not if it meant Washington imposing its will.

     <title>Bomb defused in Northern Ireland would have caused devastation</title>
     <description>
      BELFAST (Reuters) - Two bombs planted by militant Irish nationalists, including one packed with enough explosives to have killed anyone within a 50-metre (yard) radius, were defused in Northern Ireland on Saturday, police said. The 600-pound (270-kg) bomb, roughly the same size as one used to kill 29 people in the town of Omagh in the single deadliest attack of Northern Ireland's three decades of violence in 1998, was left in an abandoned vehicle in the town of Newry. ...
