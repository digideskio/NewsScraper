     <title>Rate of Statin-Linked Muscle Woes Unclear, Study Suggests</title>
     <description>
      FRIDAY, April 27 (HealthDay News) -- It's been long known that people on high doses of statins, cholesterol-lowering medications taken by millions of Americans, are at risk for a rare yet serious muscle condition. However, new research suggests that the frequency of the condition, called rhabdomyolysis, is a bit less clear due to confusion with the codes health professionals use to classify and report such problems.

     <title>Slightly-overactive thyroid tied to heart problems</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new report suggests higher-than-normal thyroid activity is linked to a greater risk of heart disease, including irregular heartbeats. People with so-called subclinical hyperthyroidism have a slightly-overactive thyroid -- a gland at the front of the neck responsible for regulating metabolism by releasing certain hormones. Those people often don't have the typical signs of full-on hyperthyroidism, such as increased appetite, restlessness and fatigue -- so the condition may frequently go undiagnosed. ...

     <title>Toward a Drug-Free Burger: Ruling May Curb Antibiotics in Meat</title>
     <description>
      The oil industry gets a lot of attention, but for my money the most powerful lobby in U.S. politics is agriculture. Between commodity crops and meat, the sector is huge. Plus, the very makeup of the U.S. political system, with lightly populated rural states getting disproportionate power in the Senate, ensures that agricultural interests will almost always get a friendly hearing in Congress, no matter which party is in power. And farming has always had a special place in the American psyche, even though fewer than 2% of Americans farm for a living these days. ...

     <title>Americans Support Medicare Reform, But Not on Their Dime: Poll</title>
     <description>
      THURSDAY, April 26 (HealthDay News) -- Medicare, the federal health insurance program for older and disabled Americans, may be hurtling toward the critical list, but most people don't want to pay for needed reforms from their own wallets, a new Harris Interactive/HealthDay poll finds.

     <title>FDA rejects Amgen's application for Xgeva</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators rejected the application by Amgen Inc, the world's biggest biotechnology company, to expand the use of the drug Xgeva to delay the spread of tumors to the bone in patients suffering from advanced prostate cancer. Xgeva and a related osteoporosis drug Prolia are seen as among the most important growth drivers for Amgen and may help offset declining sales of anemia drugs, analysts say. ...
