A sharp re-emergence of fears over contagion from the euro zone debt crisis took a steep toll on bank shares in both Europe and the United States, as well as dragging down the euro against the dollar for the first time in three days. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

South Sudanese troops wrested control of the Heglig oilfield from Sudan on Tuesday, prompting widespread condemnation from global powers and vows of retaliation from Khartoum. The Sudanese army said late on Friday its forces were advancing on Heglig, vital to Sudan's economy because a field there accounted for about half of its 115,000-barrel-a-day oil output. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The new prices come into effect on April 15 and stay in force for a month. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Sudan pound hits low after south takes oilfield</title>
     <description>
      KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The Sudanese pound has hit a historic low on the black market as people rush to move savings into dollars, fearing an economic crisis will deepen after South Sudan seized a vital oilfield, money traders said on Saturday. Sudan has been gripped by economic crisis since South Sudan seceded in July, taking with it three quarters of the formerly united country's oil output, and local people find it hard to buy foreign currency legitimately. The loss of oil revenue has driven up the cost of imports and fuelled food inflation. ...

     <title>How the major stock indexes fared on Friday</title>
     <description>
      Stocks wrapped up their worst week of the year Friday. Stocks also fell in Europe as borrowing costs rose for Spain and Italy. If those countries have to pay more to borrow, they'll have less money for other things, like jump-starting economic growth. The Dow was down all day but selling accelerated in the last half-hour. All 10 sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell, led by bank stocks.

Sudan has been gripped by economic crisis since South Sudan seceded in July, taking with it three quarters of the formerly united country's oil output, and local people find it hard to buy foreign currency legitimately. The loss of oil revenue has driven up the cost of imports and fuelled food inflation. ...

     <title>How the major stock indexes fared on Friday</title>
     <description>
      Stocks wrapped up their worst week of the year Friday. Stocks also fell in Europe as borrowing costs rose for Spain and Italy. If those countries have to pay more to borrow, they'll have less money for other things, like jump-starting economic growth. The Dow was down all day but selling accelerated in the last half-hour. All 10 sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell, led by bank stocks.
