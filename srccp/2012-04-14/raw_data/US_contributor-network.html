     <description>
      Earlier this week, a couple from Allegan County, Mich., was charged with animal cruelty when nearly 400 small-breed dogs were found at the couple's dog breeding establishment.

     <title>Newt Gingrich Bounces Check Drawn on Bank of Delusion</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Newt Gingrich bounced a $500 check in Utah in late March, according to ABC News, a check that was to get his name on the Utah primary ballot. It says a lot about Newt Gingrich and his campaign that their finances have dropped to the point of bouncing checks, not to mention the effort is an exercise in futility since Utah, the last primary to be held and in a Mormon stronghold, is winner-take-all.

     <title>Majority of Proposed Measures Suggests GOP War on Women Exists</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Republicans are hard at work trying to combat the impression the party consists of a bunch of club-wielding misogynists and female members in denial. While there is a distraction going on over Barack Obama supporter Hilary Rosen's remarks about Ann Romney never working, it should be noted Ann Romney, like other conservative women, denies what the Republican Party is doing in state legislatures.

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | We might all recall a time when we played a game called &quot;What's wrong with this picture?&quot; where we looked at the picture and tired to guess what was out of place. The recent &quot;40 Days of Prayer&quot; sponsored by a local chapter of Planned Parenthood certainly fills the bill.

     <title>Should Politicians Practice Medicine?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Can someone explain why nonmedically trained bureaucrats can make medical decisions for others? Case in point: Gov. Jan Brewer and all Republican lawmakers in Arizona.

     <title>Ron Paul Makes Texas Campaign Swing</title>
     <description>
      With Rick Santorum out of the race and Newt Gingrich's campaign a shadow of its former self, the conventional wisdom is that Mitt Romney is the presumptive Republican nominee. But Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, begs to disagree. Paul has just finished a three-day campaign swing in Texas, which has a primary on May 29. During the trip he surprised many, including in his own campaign, concerning relations with the state of Israel.

     <title>Santorum Donor Puts His Foot in His Mouth Again</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Judging from a report by ABC OTUS News, Foster Friess -- a multimillionaire responsible for bankrolling much of Rick Santorum's presidential campaign -- likes speaking in metaphors. So it shouldn't be a problem to say that the man who, just a couple of months ago, brought us the now infamous Bayer-aspirin-as-birth-control remark has put his foot in his mouth again.

     <title>Hands-Off Ann Romney for Staying Home to Raise Kids</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Ann Romney has been fending off insults from several women in the Democrat camp for her stay-at-home-mom status. Romney's husband Mitt Romney, heir-presumptive to the GOP nomination, has been touting his wife as the go-to girl on women in the economy. Activist Hilary Rosen faulted his logic, saying Mrs. Romney has &quot;never worked a day in her life,&quot; says the Christian Science Monitor. National Organization of Women president Terry O'Neill claimed Romney lacks &quot;life experience,&quot; reports Newsbusters .

     <title>Gingrich Flips, Then Flops on Supporting Mitt Romney</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | You know folks, I just don't know what to make of Newt Gingrich sometimes. Never mind his stance on political issues; I'm fairly certain that he flip flops on everyday issues more often than a flapjack cook's spatula. One day it seems he is singing a man's praises. The next, he could be speaking ill of the same person. I'll give you all an example.

Mitt Romney, reacts at Faneuil Hall in Boston after signing into law his landmark health care bill, designed to guarantee health insurance to virtually all Massachusetts residents. The law provided a blueprint for President Barack Obama's health care law, which Romney has vowed to dismantle. Ironically the &quot;Romneycare&quot; vs. &quot;Obamacare&quot; debate has given Romney with his most succinct retort, that issues of health care should be left to the states, not the federal government.

     <description>

     <title>Newt Gingrich Bounces Check Drawn on Bank of Delusion</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Newt Gingrich bounced a $500 check in Utah in late March, according to ABC News, a check that was to get his name on the Utah primary ballot. It says a lot about Newt Gingrich and his campaign that their finances have dropped to the point of bouncing checks, not to mention the effort is an exercise in futility since Utah, the last primary to be held and in a Mormon stronghold, is winner-take-all.

     <title>Majority of Proposed Measures Suggests GOP War on Women Exists</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Republicans are hard at work trying to combat the impression the party consists of a bunch of club-wielding misogynists and female members in denial. While there is a distraction going on over Barack Obama supporter Hilary Rosen's remarks about Ann Romney never working, it should be noted Ann Romney, like other conservative women, denies what the Republican Party is doing in state legislatures.

     <title>Ron Paul Makes Texas Campaign Swing</title>
     <description>
      With Rick Santorum out of the race and Newt Gingrich's campaign a shadow of its former self, the conventional wisdom is that Mitt Romney is the presumptive Republican nominee. But Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, begs to disagree. Paul has just finished a three-day campaign swing in Texas, which has a primary on May 29. During the trip he surprised many, including in his own campaign, concerning relations with the state of Israel.

     <title>Santorum Donor Puts His Foot in His Mouth Again</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Judging from a report by ABC OTUS News, Foster Friess -- a multimillionaire responsible for bankrolling much of Rick Santorum's presidential campaign -- likes speaking in metaphors. So it shouldn't be a problem to say that the man who, just a couple of months ago, brought us the now infamous Bayer-aspirin-as-birth-control remark has put his foot in his mouth again.

     <title>Hands-Off Ann Romney for Staying Home to Raise Kids</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Ann Romney has been fending off insults from several women in the Democrat camp for her stay-at-home-mom status. Romney's husband Mitt Romney, heir-presumptive to the GOP nomination, has been touting his wife as the go-to girl on women in the economy. Activist Hilary Rosen faulted his logic, saying Mrs. Romney has &quot;never worked a day in her life,&quot; says the Christian Science Monitor. National Organization of Women president Terry O'Neill claimed Romney lacks &quot;life experience,&quot; reports Newsbusters .

     <title>Gingrich Flips, Then Flops on Supporting Mitt Romney</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | You know folks, I just don't know what to make of Newt Gingrich sometimes. Never mind his stance on political issues; I'm fairly certain that he flip flops on everyday issues more often than a flapjack cook's spatula. One day it seems he is singing a man's praises. The next, he could be speaking ill of the same person. I'll give you all an example.
