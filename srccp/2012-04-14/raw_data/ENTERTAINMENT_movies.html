The film, which stars Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penelope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page, had its world premiere in the Eternal City on Friday. Made up of four separate stories, it is his first set in Rome, which Allen called &quot;a feast for a filmmaker&quot;. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The &quot;Golden Girls&quot; icon, who turned 90 years young in January, launched her official Twitter account Tuesday, offering an adoring public a glimpse into the still-spry actress' fertile mind, 140 characters at a time. The actress's maiden tweet was a typical bit of witticism (or is that White-icism?) designed to enchant and delight the masses. &quot;Hello Twitter! And they said it would never happen. Oh wait, that was me,&quot; White cracked. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Domestic distributor Paramount is projecting that the film, converted into 3D for a hefty $18 million, will take in around $20 million-$25 million over the five-day holiday weekend. Box-office observers outside the studio say it could do up to $30 million. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

And if you love the films of Whit Stillman — the writer-director of &quot;Metropolitan,&quot; &quot;Barcelona&quot; and &quot;The Last Days of Disco,&quot; who hasn't released a film since 1998 — you'll be thrilled to know that he's finally got a new movie in theaters, even if it doesn't quite recapture the old magic. ...

The film, which stars Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penelope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page, had its world premiere in the Eternal City on Friday. Made up of four separate stories, it is his first set in Rome, which Allen called &quot;a feast for a filmmaker&quot;. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The &quot;Golden Girls&quot; icon, who turned 90 years young in January, launched her official Twitter account Tuesday, offering an adoring public a glimpse into the still-spry actress' fertile mind, 140 characters at a time. The actress's maiden tweet was a typical bit of witticism (or is that White-icism?) designed to enchant and delight the masses. &quot;Hello Twitter! And they said it would never happen. Oh wait, that was me,&quot; White cracked. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

A spokesman for the studio told TheWrap, &quot;We are analyzing what to do with the project.&quot; Jewish groups were outraged after news broke in September that Gibson had reached a production deal with Warner Bros. to direct the story of Judah Maccabee, whose victory over Greek and Syrian armies is celebrated at Hanukkah. One Jewish group called it &quot;a moral lapse in judgment. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Domestic distributor Paramount is projecting that the film, converted into 3D for a hefty $18 million, will take in around $20 million-$25 million over the five-day holiday weekend. Box-office observers outside the studio say it could do up to $30 million. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

And if you love the films of Whit Stillman — the writer-director of &quot;Metropolitan,&quot; &quot;Barcelona&quot; and &quot;The Last Days of Disco,&quot; who hasn't released a film since 1998 — you'll be thrilled to know that he's finally got a new movie in theaters, even if it doesn't quite recapture the old magic. ...
