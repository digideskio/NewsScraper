The greenhouse-gas emissions rules - designed to fit with measures already set in the United States - will come into effect starting with the 2014 model year. They will apply to full-size pickups, heavy trucks and buses as well as to cement, garbage and dump trucks. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Arctic generals agree closer ties at historic meet</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - Defense chiefs from eight Arctic nations agreed on Friday to cooperate more closely to deal with disasters and search and rescue operations in the remote resource-rich region, Canada's top soldier said. As the Arctic warms up, major nations are jostling for influence in a frozen part of the world believed to contain vast reserves of oil, gas, gold, diamonds, zinc and iron. ...

The Canada Industrial Relations Board ordered the Air Canada Pilots Association (ACPA) &quot;to take all reasonable steps to bring to an end the illegal strike&quot; and to require all participating pilots to &quot;immediately return to work,&quot; the carrier said late Friday.

     <title>Canada regulators impose tough rules on &quot;dark&quot; trades</title>
     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's securities watchdogs unveiled strict rules on Friday for anonymous stock trades in so-called &quot;dark pools,&quot; a move the regulators said was aimed at protecting investors from the risk of unfair pricing. Dark pools allow some players, often big institutions, to match orders while concealing price and volume. By enabling them to hide their cards, the dark pools limit the impact of an order on the stock's price before the trade's completion. ...

     <title>Canada to subsidize northern grain shipments</title>
     <description>
      WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - The Canadian government said on Friday it will offer grain handlers a subsidy for shipping grain through the country's only Arctic port, which stands to lose volume once the western grains market opens for competition. The Canadian Wheat Board is by far the biggest shipper through Manitoba's Port of Churchill, but the CWB will lose its marketing monopoly over wheat and barley with the next harvest under a new federal law. ...

     <title>Canada won't join bailout fund for Europe</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada has no desire to contribute to a bailout fund for Europe, a spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on Thursday, noting that European issues are likely to come up at this weekend's Summit of the Americas in Colombia, which Harper will attend. &quot;I think the euro zone is of particular interest, obviously. That situation remains unresolved,&quot; spokesman Andrew MacDougall told reporters. &quot;The biggest threat to the global recovery remains Europe.&quot; Canada has said that Europe has enough resources of its own to deal with its economic troubles. ...

Justice Geoffrey Morawetz of the Ontario Superior Court declined the Toronto-listed company's request for an extension until July 9, but agreed to leave the order in place for about a month beyond its initial April 29 expiration.

      OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - The Nebraska Legislature approved a bill on Wednesday that would provide support for an expected new route for TransCanada Corp's Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL crude oil pipeline that would bypass an environmentally sensitive region in the state.

     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - Although Canada's output of greenhouse gases was almost unchanged in 2010 from 2009, the major oil producer will find it tough to meet its 2020 emissions-cut target, government figures signaled on Wednesday. Conservative government officials hailed the data, which showed emissions in Canada rose by just 0.25 percent in 2010 from the year before, hitting 692 megatons. The economy grew by 3.2 percent in the same period. ...

A sharp re-emergence of fears over contagion from the euro zone debt crisis took a steep toll on bank shares in both Europe and the United States, as well as dragging down the euro against the dollar for the first time in three days. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

As the Arctic warms up, major nations are jostling for influence in a frozen part of the world believed to contain vast reserves of oil, gas, gold, diamonds, zinc and iron. ...

     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's securities watchdogs unveiled strict rules on Friday for anonymous stock trades in so-called &quot;dark pools,&quot; a move the regulators said was aimed at protecting investors from the risk of unfair pricing. Dark pools allow some players, often big institutions, to match orders while concealing price and volume. By enabling them to hide their cards, the dark pools limit the impact of an order on the stock's price before the trade's completion. ...

     <title>Canada to subsidize northern grain shipments</title>
     <description>
      WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - The Canadian government said on Friday it will offer grain handlers a subsidy for shipping grain through the country's only Arctic port, which stands to lose volume once the western grains market opens for competition. The Canadian Wheat Board is by far the biggest shipper through Manitoba's Port of Churchill, but the CWB will lose its marketing monopoly over wheat and barley with the next harvest under a new federal law. ...

      OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada has no desire to contribute to a bailout fund for Europe, a spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on Thursday, noting that European issues are likely to come up at this weekend's Summit of the Americas in Colombia, which Harper will attend. &quot;I think the euro zone is of particular interest, obviously. That situation remains unresolved,&quot; spokesman Andrew MacDougall told reporters. &quot;The biggest threat to the global recovery remains Europe.&quot; Canada has said that Europe has enough resources of its own to deal with its economic troubles. ...

Conservative government officials hailed the data, which showed emissions in Canada rose by just 0.25 percent in 2010 from the year before, hitting 692 megatons. The economy grew by 3.2 percent in the same period. ...
