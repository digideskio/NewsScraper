     <title>California Supreme Court Says Lunch is on You, Employees</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to the Associated Press, California's Supreme Court has ruled employers aren't mandated to force employees to eat during lunch breaks. Employers cannot deprive an employee of a lunch break, but whether the employee actually takes the break is his or her decision.

     <title>Campaign 2012 and the War on Women</title>
     <description>
      Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday the &quot;war on women is real&quot; and will intensify as the next president makes Supreme Court nominations, Politico reported. U.S. News and World Report agrees that the political right is waging a war on women and that it is likely to have an impact at the polls. That publication says the war is evident from a review of legislation put forth by Republicans who came to power in 2010, including personhood amendments, ultrasound bills and efforts to criminalize birth control.

     <title>Judge to review moving hundreds of Madoff cases</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the sprawling litigation to recover money related to Bernard Madoff's fraud, a federal judge said he would decide whether a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling prevents a bankruptcy court from resolving hundreds of lawsuits brought by the Madoff firm's trustee. Defendants in those cases have sought to transfer their cases to district court from bankruptcy court, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the estate of former Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith that limited the power of bankruptcy judges to review claims. In an order published Friday, U.S. ...

     <title>California Supreme Court Ruling: No Such Thing as Forced Lunch</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Associated Press provides some food for thought in discussing a recent ruling by the California Supreme Court that affirms the right of workers to work through lunch. Or, to be taken another way, affirms the right of employers to &quot;allow&quot; workers to toil over the mid-day breaks, with &quot;allow&quot; possibly running to gamut from subtle hints to explicit suggestions that workers keep toiling to get their tasks completed. What are some sensitive issues regarding a lunch break where a period of rest is not required?

      JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. - Mitt Romney is headlining the annual convention of the most powerful American gun lobby on Friday, courting gun-rights activists even as the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager thrust the divisive issue of arms control to the forefront of election-year politics.

      AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the United Nations cannot be prosecuted in the Netherlands for failing to prevent genocide against Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica near the end of Bosnia's war in 1995. The final ruling was the last legal option in the Netherlands for a group of survivors of the July 1995 massacre, when as many as 8,000 boys and men were killed by Serb forces in an area that the United Nations had declared a &quot;safe haven&quot;. ...

      BAMAKO (Reuters) - Former parliament speaker Dioncounda Traore took over as Mali's interim president on Thursday from the leaders of last month's coup, promising to hold elections and fight rebels occupying half the country. Traore, 70, a labour activist turned politician, was sworn in by Supreme Court President Nouhoum Tapily in the capital Bamako as part of a deal to restore civilian rule after army officers staged a March 22 coup in the West African state. The coup shattered predominantly Muslim Mali's image as one of the most peaceful and stable states in the region. ...

     <title>California Supreme Court Says Lunch is on You, Employees</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to the Associated Press, California's Supreme Court has ruled employers aren't mandated to force employees to eat during lunch breaks. Employers cannot deprive an employee of a lunch break, but whether the employee actually takes the break is his or her decision.

     <title>Campaign 2012 and the War on Women</title>
     <description>
      Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday the &quot;war on women is real&quot; and will intensify as the next president makes Supreme Court nominations, Politico reported. U.S. News and World Report agrees that the political right is waging a war on women and that it is likely to have an impact at the polls. That publication says the war is evident from a review of legislation put forth by Republicans who came to power in 2010, including personhood amendments, ultrasound bills and efforts to criminalize birth control.

     <title>Judge to review moving hundreds of Madoff cases</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the sprawling litigation to recover money related to Bernard Madoff's fraud, a federal judge said he would decide whether a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling prevents a bankruptcy court from resolving hundreds of lawsuits brought by the Madoff firm's trustee. Defendants in those cases have sought to transfer their cases to district court from bankruptcy court, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the estate of former Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith that limited the power of bankruptcy judges to review claims. In an order published Friday, U.S. ...

     <title>California Supreme Court Ruling: No Such Thing as Forced Lunch</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Associated Press provides some food for thought in discussing a recent ruling by the California Supreme Court that affirms the right of workers to work through lunch. Or, to be taken another way, affirms the right of employers to &quot;allow&quot; workers to toil over the mid-day breaks, with &quot;allow&quot; possibly running to gamut from subtle hints to explicit suggestions that workers keep toiling to get their tasks completed. What are some sensitive issues regarding a lunch break where a period of rest is not required?

      JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. - Mitt Romney is headlining the annual convention of the most powerful American gun lobby on Friday, courting gun-rights activists even as the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager thrust the divisive issue of arms control to the forefront of election-year politics.
