     <title>Kenya shilling buoyed by exporters selling dollars</title>
     <description>
      NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Kenyan shilling firmed on Friday aided by exporters taking advantage of the previous day's fall to sell dollars, while the central bank sought to mop up excess local currency liquidity for the fifth straight day. At 0945 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 83.15/35 per dollar, firmer than Thursday's close of 83.40/50. Sameer Lagadia, head of trading at Diamond Trust Bank, said exporters converting dollar earnings would support the shilling. The central bank mopped up 6.5 billion shillings during the session, at a weighted average rate of 15. ...

     <description>
      LAGOS (Reuters) - Shares in Nigeria's Sterling Bank rose the maximum 5 percent to 1.26 naira per share on Friday after the lender said it would pay a 0.10 naira dividend per share from its profit for 2011.

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Option traders appear to be stepping up bullish positions in an exchange-traded fund tied to a basket of financial stocks just ahead of a slew of earnings from big U.S. banks. Shares of the Financial Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund XLF which tracks financial-related companies from the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 1.9 percent to $15.49 on Thursday.
