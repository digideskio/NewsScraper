     <title>These Contact Lenses Give You Superhuman Vision</title>
     <description>
      Contact lens wearers can get a new perspective on their environment with the latest vision technology -- contact lenses that let the wearer focus on two fields of view at once. Wearers can keep an eye on a projected image while their surrounding scenery can also be looked at -- resulting in superhuman vision.

The discovery is reassuring for a species seen as under threat from global warming and will provide researchers with a benchmark for monitoring the giants of the penguin world in years to come. Using high-resolution satellite images to study each of 44 colonies around the coastline of Antarctica, experts said on Friday they put the total emperor penguin population at 595,000, or roughly double previous estimates of 270,000 to 350,000. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

They have concluded that the most revealing slice of time is the Pliocene Epoch, a warm, wet period between 3.15 million and 2.85 million years ago, when the world probably looked and felt much as it does now. Global temperatures and the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were similar to today's climate, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The measure, which became law Tuesday, made Tennessee the second state, after Louisiana, to enable teachers to more easily teach alternative theories to the widely accepted scientific concepts of evolution and human-caused climate change. At least five other states considered similar legislation this year. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Science has confirmed what we all already knew (and feared?),&nbsp;last month was the warmest since 1895, which is as far as the record goes back. &quot;The average temperature of 51.1&deg;F was 8.6 degrees above the 20th century average for March and 0.5&deg;F warmer than the previous warmest March in 1910,&quot; explains the research report. ...

     <title>Engineering Humans: A New Solution to Climate Change?</title>
     <description>
      So far, conventional solutions to global warming — new government policies and changes in individual behavior — haven't delivered. And more radical options, such as pumping sulfur into the atmosphere to counteract warming, pose a great deal of risk.

     <title>These Contact Lenses Give You Superhuman Vision</title>
     <description>
      Contact lens wearers can get a new perspective on their environment with the latest vision technology -- contact lenses that let the wearer focus on two fields of view at once. Wearers can keep an eye on a projected image while their surrounding scenery can also be looked at -- resulting in superhuman vision.

The discovery is reassuring for a species seen as under threat from global warming and will provide researchers with a benchmark for monitoring the giants of the penguin world in years to come. Using high-resolution satellite images to study each of 44 colonies around the coastline of Antarctica, experts said on Friday they put the total emperor penguin population at 595,000, or roughly double previous estimates of 270,000 to 350,000. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Global temperatures and the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were similar to today's climate, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Global sales are predicted to grow nearly 46% to 687.9 million units this year, and then to reach 1.05 billion units in 2014. The growth is said to be fueled by strong demand in China and the launch of cheaper low-end handsets. “We see robust growth for the smartphone market in China, which we think will account for 22 percent of global units by 2015,” Credit Suisse&nbsp;analysts including Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a note. The firm expects Apple to make large gains in an environment where the “success in smartphones will be impacted by success in PCs and tablets.” The Cupertino-based&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Tennessee teacher law could boost creationism, climate denial</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - A new Tennessee law protects teachers who explore the &quot;scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses&quot; of evolution and climate change, a move science education advocates say could make it easier for creationism and global warming denial to enter U.S. classrooms. The measure, which became law Tuesday, made Tennessee the second state, after Louisiana, to enable teachers to more easily teach alternative theories to the widely accepted scientific concepts of evolution and human-caused climate change. At least five other states considered similar legislation this year. ...

     <title>Electric Cars to Tell Power Grid When to Charge Them</title>
     <description>
      Owners of electric and hybrid cars just want plug in and charge up without thinking, but growing numbers of such vehicles could overload the aging U.S. power grid. A new project looks to stave off trouble by testing how cars and power grids can &quot;talk&quot; to figure out the best charging schedules.

     <description>
      Discovered in Green: The warmest March ever, the deadly effects of these unusual temps, imported plants import unwanted pests and at least one species can adapt to the acidification of the oceans.&nbsp;March's warm weather broke a lot of records. Science has confirmed what we all already knew (and feared?),&nbsp;last month was the warmest since 1895, which is as far as the record goes back. &quot;The average temperature of 51.1&deg;F was 8.6 degrees above the 20th century average for March and 0.5&deg;F warmer than the previous warmest March in 1910,&quot; explains the research report. ...
