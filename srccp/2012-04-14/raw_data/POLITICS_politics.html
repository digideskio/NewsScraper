     <title>U.S. says Syria shelling of Homs violates ceasefire</title>
     <description>
      UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. envoy to the United Nations Susan Rice said on Saturday that Syria's shelling of the city of Homs had violated a fragile ceasefire in the 13-month-long conflict that has brought the country to the brink of civil war. Activists reported the first shelling on Saturday in Homs by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad since the U.N.-Arab League-brokered ceasefire took effect on Thursday.

Obama's campaign has been pushing Romney, a multi-millionaire former private equity executive, to release several years of his prior tax returns to shed light on how he amassed his wealth. In an interview conducted on Friday and released on Saturday, an anchor for the Spanish-language network noted Obama had released his tax returns for 12 years and asked him if Romney should do the same. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Peru says hostages freed, clashes with Shining Path</title>
     <description>
      LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's Shining Path early on Saturday released 36 gas pipeline workers it took hostage six days ago in a remote jungle region in southern Peru, the government said, saying security forces had clashed with the rebels. The Defense Ministry said the rebels let the workers go before dawn after they were circled by 1,500 security agents and tried to flee, in a victory for President Ollanta Humala, who fought the group while in the army in the 1990s. Some of the captives said they walked through the jungle for hours after they were released. ...

In a statement, Assistant Director Paul Morrissey said the Secret Service replaced the agents after allegations were made on Thursday, in line with the Secret Service's &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy on personal misconduct. ...

     <title>U.S. says Syria shelling of Homs violates ceasefire</title>
     <description>
      UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. envoy to the United Nations Susan Rice said on Saturday that Syria's shelling of the city of Homs had violated a fragile ceasefire in the 13-month-long conflict that has brought the country to the brink of civil war. Activists reported the first shelling on Saturday in Homs by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad since the U.N.-Arab League-brokered ceasefire took effect on Thursday.

One day after the U.S. Secret Service said it had sent some agents home from Cartagena for allegations of misconduct - which Colombian police said involved prostitutes - the Southern Command said it was punishing military members involved in &quot;inappropriate conduct&quot; at the same hotel in which the agents had stayed. ...

      SEATTLE (Reuters) - A handful of Roman Catholic churches in Washington state, whose Catholic governor signed a law allowing gay marriage earlier this year, have refused to circulate a petition endorsed by their archbishop to repeal the law, congregation leaders said. Opponents of same-sex marriage, due to go into effect this summer in the state, have been rallying conservative religious leaders to gather the 120,577 signatures they need by June 6 to secure a spot on the November 2012 ballot for their repeal push.

      OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Two Frenchmen held hostage by al Qaeda in northern Mali since November appeared in a video on Saturday appealing to French President Nicolas Sarkozy to secure their release. The video, received by authorities in Burkina Faso and seen by a Reuters reporter, shows Philippe Verdon and Serge Lazarevic.

     <title>U.S. says Syria shelling of Homs violates ceasefire</title>
     <description>
      UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. envoy to the United Nations Susan Rice said on Saturday that Syria's shelling of the city of Homs had violated a fragile ceasefire in the 13-month-long conflict that has brought the country to the brink of civil war. Activists reported the first shelling on Saturday in Homs by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad since the U.N.-Arab League-brokered ceasefire took effect on Thursday.

Activists reported the first shelling on Saturday in Homs by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad since the U.N.-Arab League-brokered ceasefire took effect on Thursday.

     <description>

     <title>Some Washington state churches in split over gay marriage</title>
     <description>
      SEATTLE (Reuters) - A handful of Roman Catholic churches in Washington state, whose Catholic governor signed a law allowing gay marriage earlier this year, have refused to circulate a petition endorsed by their archbishop to repeal the law, congregation leaders said.

A bulletin from Seattle Archbishop J. ...
