Controlling that reaction and going where you want, when you want - that's where engineers earn their money and ulcers. And it's where past rockets and spaceships have ended in spectacular and sometimes deadly failures.

Think &quot;Star Trek&quot; technology is only the stuff of fiction? Think again. Dr. Peter Jansen, a PhD graduate of the Cognitive Science Laboratory at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, has developed a scientific measurement device based on the tricorders used by Captain Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy and other space adventurers on the classic TV series that has spawned numerous spin-offs in more than 45 years. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

They have concluded that the most revealing slice of time is the Pliocene Epoch, a warm, wet period between 3.15 million and 2.85 million years ago, when the world probably looked and felt much as it does now. Global temperatures and the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were similar to today's climate, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Comet Demolition Derby Around Star Surprises Scientists</title>
     <description>
      A young star that is home to at least one alien planet is also ringed by a vast, dusty cloud of comets, like our own solar system. But there's a big difference: There may be as many as 83 trillion comets there, with collisions destroying thousands each day, a new study suggests.

The study is in the journal Science. (AP Photo/Joel Fagot)&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; title=&quot;This undated handout photo provided by of Joel Fagot, and the journal Science shows Dora during a readng experiment. French researchers are showing that baboons can do what is essentially the first step in reading. They can identify recurring patterns _ in English. This study is important in two fields: It shows that the early steps in reading are far more instinctual than scientists first thought and it also demonstrates that non-human primates may be smarter than we give them credit for. Baboons and other monkeys are good pattern finders and it's more than memorization. What they are doing may be what we first do in recognizing words. But it's still a far cry from real reading. The study is in the journal Science. (AP Photo/Joel Fagot)&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dan the baboon sits in front of a computer screen. The letters BRRU pop up. With a quick and almost dismissive tap, the monkey signals it's not a word. Correct. Next comes, ITCS. Again, not a word. Finally KITE comes up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Scientist: Dinosaurs May Rule Alien Worlds</title>
     <description>
      Do dinosaurs rule other planets, as they used to rule the Earth more than 60 million years ago? That is the suggestion of Ronald Breslow, Ph.D., a noted Columbia University researcher, in a paper published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

They have concluded that the most revealing slice of time is the Pliocene Epoch, a warm, wet period between 3.15 million and 2.85 million years ago, when the world probably looked and felt much as it does now. Global temperatures and the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were similar to today's climate, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Comet Demolition Derby Around Star Surprises Scientists</title>
     <description>
      A young star that is home to at least one alien planet is also ringed by a vast, dusty cloud of comets, like our own solar system. But there's a big difference: There may be as many as 83 trillion comets there, with collisions destroying thousands each day, a new study suggests.
