     <title>Slight rise in military sex assault cases</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of sexual assaults reported to U.S. military authorities edged up last year, with most involving one member of the armed forces attacking another, the Pentagon said in an annual report released on Friday.

The committee, an engine of Republican Party fundraising for races for the U.S. Congress, has been digging itself out of a multimillion-dollar debt and on Friday said it owed $9.9 million at the end of March -- $1 million less than a month earlier. The committee started fundraising jointly this month with Mitt Romney, the party's likely presidential nominee. It had $32.7 million in cash on hand at the end of March. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Rep. Paul Ryan Would Make a Decent VP, but Not a Good VP Candidate</title>
     <description>
      Ever since Mitt Romney barnstormed across Wisconsin with Congressman Paul Ryan at his side, it got folks thinking about a Romney-Ryan ticket. Given that Ryan helped deliver the Dairy State to Romney, the decisive campaign that helped finish off Santorum, wouldn't the former Massachusetts Governor provide a little payback?

     <title>New U.S. sanctions may hinge on Iran talks: Congress aides</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fate of a new package of sanctions on Iran proposed by U.S. lawmakers may hinge on whether Iran and six major world powers can make any progress at high-level talks this weekend toward resolving a dispute over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. There is broad support among Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress to add more oil- and banking-related sanctions aimed at pressuring Tehran to abandon its nuclear program. But the proposed package of sanctions stalled in the gridlocked U.S. Senate in late March, just before lawmakers left Washington for a two-week break. ...

      When broadcasters gathered at this time last year in Las Vegas for their annual show, there was much anxiety over the future of over-the-air television. Congress was still weighing proposals that some broadcasters worried could force them to give up their lifeblood: spectrum.

     <title>Democrats Distilled to Core of Coalition: Women, Minorities—GRAPHIC</title>
     <description>
      Dominated by white men just 60 years ago, congressional Democrats have gradually distilled to the core of their electoral coalition--women and minorities. The Cook Political Report projects that when a new Congress is sworn into office in January, white males will likely be a minority of one party's caucus in the House for the first time in American history. It's a milestone that Democrats will celebrate regardless of whether Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wins back the speaker's gavel.

     <title>Since 1982, Minority Congressional Districts Have Tripled—GRAPHIC</title>
     <description>
      In 1980, the nonwhite share of the U.S. population was 17 percent, and by 1982 there were 35 majority nonwhite districts. In the 2010 census, the nonwhite share of the nation's population had ballooned to 28 percent, mostly fueled by Latino growth. But over the same time period, the number of nonwhite majority districts has more than tripled, to 106. For the first time ever, a majority of states--26--will contain majority nonwhite districts, in part thanks to new deliberately drawn minority-majority seats in Washington state where Asian-Americans are the largest minority group.

      Dominated by white men just 60 years ago, Congressional Democrats have gradually distilled down to the core of their electoral coalition - women and minorities. The Cook Political Report projects that when a new Congress is sworn into office in January 2013, it's virtually certain to be the first time in American history that white males are a minority of one party's caucus in the House. It's a milestone Democrats will celebrate whether Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wins back the Speaker's gavel or not.

     <title>Pentagon sets up fast track for buying cyber war tools</title>

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon is establishing a fast-track acquisition process that would enable it to develop new cyber warfare capabilities within days or months if urgently needed, the Defense Department said in a report to Congress.

By seeking a second short-term funding extension, the plan aims to put the Canada-to-Texas pipeline and expanded drilling rights back at the top of the House agenda without the struggles that the House has endured in trying to pass a longer-term, more expensive transport bill. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Rep. Paul Ryan Would Make a Decent VP, but Not a Good VP Candidate</title>
     <description>
      Ever since Mitt Romney barnstormed across Wisconsin with Congressman Paul Ryan at his side, it got folks thinking about a Romney-Ryan ticket. Given that Ryan helped deliver the Dairy State to Romney, the decisive campaign that helped finish off Santorum, wouldn't the former Massachusetts Governor provide a little payback?

     <title>New U.S. sanctions may hinge on Iran talks: Congress aides</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fate of a new package of sanctions on Iran proposed by U.S. lawmakers may hinge on whether Iran and six major world powers can make any progress at high-level talks this weekend toward resolving a dispute over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. There is broad support among Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress to add more oil- and banking-related sanctions aimed at pressuring Tehran to abandon its nuclear program. But the proposed package of sanctions stalled in the gridlocked U.S. Senate in late March, just before lawmakers left Washington for a two-week break. ...

     <title>Democrats Distilled to Core of Coalition: Women, Minorities—GRAPHIC</title>
     <description>
      Dominated by white men just 60 years ago, congressional Democrats have gradually distilled to the core of their electoral coalition--women and minorities. The Cook Political Report projects that when a new Congress is sworn into office in January, white males will likely be a minority of one party's caucus in the House for the first time in American history. It's a milestone that Democrats will celebrate regardless of whether Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wins back the speaker's gavel.

     <title>Since 1982, Minority Congressional Districts Have Tripled—GRAPHIC</title>
     <description>
      In 1980, the nonwhite share of the U.S. population was 17 percent, and by 1982 there were 35 majority nonwhite districts. In the 2010 census, the nonwhite share of the nation's population had ballooned to 28 percent, mostly fueled by Latino growth. But over the same time period, the number of nonwhite majority districts has more than tripled, to 106. For the first time ever, a majority of states--26--will contain majority nonwhite districts, in part thanks to new deliberately drawn minority-majority seats in Washington state where Asian-Americans are the largest minority group.

     <title>Democrats Distilled to Core of Coalition: Women, Minorites—GRAPHIC</title>
     <description>
      Dominated by white men just 60 years ago, Congressional Democrats have gradually distilled down to the core of their electoral coalition - women and minorities. The Cook Political Report projects that when a new Congress is sworn into office in January 2013, it's virtually certain to be the first time in American history that white males are a minority of one party's caucus in the House. It's a milestone Democrats will celebrate whether Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wins back the Speaker's gavel or not.

     <title>House leader defends new Pa. drilling law</title>
     <description>
      House Speaker Sam Smith said Thursday it's &quot;outrageous&quot; for doctors to suggest that Pennsylvania's new Marcellus Shale law could gag them from talking to their patients about chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.

     <title>Pentagon sets up fast track for buying cyber war tools</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon is establishing a fast-track acquisition process that would enable it to develop new cyber warfare capabilities within days or months if urgently needed, the Defense Department said in a report to Congress. The process, which would be overseen by a new senior-level Cyber Investment Management Board, aims to streamline the sluggish traditional defense acquisition process to meet the rapid pace of events in cyberspace, the 16-page report said. ...
