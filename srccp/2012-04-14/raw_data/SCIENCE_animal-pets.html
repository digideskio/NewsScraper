Escalating rancor between hunters and animal rights activists on social media and websites centers on pictures of wolves killed or about to be killed.

     <title>Senior Is Eager To Prevent Life From Going To The Dogs</title>
     <description>

Barker agreed to foot the bill to move Thika, Iringa and Toka to PAWS Sanctuary in San Andreas, California from the Toronto Zoo after growing concerned that Canada's chilly climate was unsuitable for them.

     <title>False Killer Whales Focus Sound Waves to 'See' Prey</title>

     <title>Animal Psychologists Discover What Music Pets Prefer</title>
     <description>
      Many pet owners leave their home radios playing all day for the listening pleasure of their dogs and cats. Station choices vary. &quot;We have a very human tendency to project onto our pets and assume that they will like what we like,&quot; said Charles Snowdon, an authority on the musical preferences of animals. &quot;People assume that if they like Mozart, their dog will like Mozart. If they like rock music, they say their dog prefers rock.&quot;

     <description>
      BERLIN (Reuters) - A fawn-colored baby rabbit tipped for fame in Germany as he was born without ears was accidentally trampled and killed by a cameraman who had come to a zoo to film him, German media reported this week. &quot;I can't believe it.

The rabbit, due to be named &quot;Til&quot;, had hopped behind the cameraman during filming in his small hay-strewn stall at the zoo in Limbach-Oberfrohna, and was crushed as the cameraman took a step backwards. ...

     <title>Web privacy rules turn poachers into gamekeepers</title>
     <description>
      BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When you 'like' something on Facebook or read an online newspaper, perhaps a dozen or more companies are squirreling away data on your tastes, your habits, whether you're male or female, old or young, gay or straight. They mean no harm. They just want to give you, the customer, exactly what you want - it's the grandfather of all business slogans. Their dilemma, now regulators' noses are twitching, is how to serve you, and serve themselves, when what you want is to be left alone. ...

     <title>Senior Is Eager To Prevent Life From Going To The Dogs</title>
     <description>
      DEAR ABBY: I'm a 17-year-old senior with a single, very controlling mother. It's impossible to have a sit-down conversation with her because she's always working to support us. She works as a dog groomer. She's always polite to her customers and friends, but she turns into a witch when it's just her and us kids.I have never had any freedom. I go to school, come home and groom dogs, then it's the same cycle all over again. She makes me feel useless unless I'm working for her, and the truth is I think she wants me to live with her forever. ...

     <description>
      Many pet owners leave their home radios playing all day for the listening pleasure of their dogs and cats. Station choices vary. &quot;We have a very human tendency to project onto our pets and assume that they will like what we like,&quot; said Charles Snowdon, an authority on the musical preferences of animals. &quot;People assume that if they like Mozart, their dog will like Mozart. If they like rock music, they say their dog prefers rock.&quot;

      BERLIN (Reuters) - A fawn-colored baby rabbit tipped for fame in Germany as he was born without ears was accidentally trampled and killed by a cameraman who had come to a zoo to film him, German media reported this week. &quot;I can't believe it.
