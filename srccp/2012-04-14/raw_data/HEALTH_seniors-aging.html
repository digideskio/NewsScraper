     <title>First Person: Guarding Against Forced Retirement</title>
     <description>
      I subscribe to the belief that ages 40 and 50 are the new 30, as does my neighbor, a young-looking 50-something. But that sentiment came crashing down for him one day when a 20-something at work referred to him as the &quot;old guy.&quot; He swallowed his ego for that incident, but he now has a bug in his ear that his company might force him to retire because of age. After doing some research, I told my neighbor not to worry too much because there are laws regarding forced retirement.

     <title>How to get the most from Social Security</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - The trustees of Social Security will release their annual report on the program's health sometime in the next few weeks, and the news will not be good. The 2012 briefing is expected to show further deterioration in Social Security's financial outlook, due to the higher-than-expected 2.9 percent cost-of-living adjustment awarded this year and a decline in the taxable wage base available to the program. The report is the official gauge of the program's health - signed by three Cabinet members, the Social Security commissioner and two independent Congressional appointees. ...

     <title>Why the Early-Retirement Trend Reversed in 2011</title>
     <description>
      Americans sharply reduced their rate of claiming Social Security benefits last year, thus reversing--at least temporarily--one of the more dramatic retirement consequences of the Great Recession.

Already the cost of caring for aging baby boomers is beginning to strain government budgets, particularly in advanced economies where by 2050 the elderly will match the numbers of workers almost one for one. The IMF study shows that the problem is global and that longevity is a bigger risk than thought. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>First Person: Guarding Against Forced Retirement</title>
     <description>
      I subscribe to the belief that ages 40 and 50 are the new 30, as does my neighbor, a young-looking 50-something. But that sentiment came crashing down for him one day when a 20-something at work referred to him as the &quot;old guy.&quot; He swallowed his ego for that incident, but he now has a bug in his ear that his company might force him to retire because of age. After doing some research, I told my neighbor not to worry too much because there are laws regarding forced retirement.

     <title>How to get the most from Social Security</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - The trustees of Social Security will release their annual report on the program's health sometime in the next few weeks, and the news will not be good. The 2012 briefing is expected to show further deterioration in Social Security's financial outlook, due to the higher-than-expected 2.9 percent cost-of-living adjustment awarded this year and a decline in the taxable wage base available to the program. The report is the official gauge of the program's health - signed by three Cabinet members, the Social Security commissioner and two independent Congressional appointees. ...

     <title>Why the Early-Retirement Trend Reversed in 2011</title>
     <description>
      Americans sharply reduced their rate of claiming Social Security benefits last year, thus reversing--at least temporarily--one of the more dramatic retirement consequences of the Great Recession. According to an analysis by the nonprofit Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., the Social Security claiming rate hit a 35-year low in 2011 after soaring 25 percent during the 2007-2009 period.
