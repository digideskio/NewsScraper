      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The odds of winning the $640-million &quot;Mega Millions&quot; lottery are estimated to be 175 million-to-1, according to its sponsors, but for the Internal Revenue Service, it's a sure thing. No matter who wins the largest lottery jackpot in world history, the IRS is certain to score a 25-percent cut.

     <title>First Person: We Saved Over $1,410 on a Used Car</title>
     <description>
      Our 1991 Dodge Dynasty has almost 300,000 miles on it and our 1996 Mazda Protege' has 248,000 miles on it. It was time for a new car and we needed a plan. We crunched the numbers and knew that our budget was tight so we agreed to use our tax return to get another used car. Knowing that neither of our other cars would bring anything in for a trade in value we decided we'd have to fix one up and sell it and keep the other one. We set that project aside for a summer yard sale event.

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The odds of winning the $640-million &quot;Mega Millions&quot; lottery are estimated to be 175 million-to-1, according to its sponsors, but for the Internal Revenue Service, it's a sure thing. No matter who wins the largest lottery jackpot in world history, the IRS is certain to score a 25-percent cut. The tax-collecting agency subjects lottery winnings of more than $5,000 to a 25-percent federal withholding tax. ...

     <title>First Person: We Saved Over $1,410 on a Used Car</title>
     <description>
      Our 1991 Dodge Dynasty has almost 300,000 miles on it and our 1996 Mazda Protege' has 248,000 miles on it. It was time for a new car and we needed a plan. We crunched the numbers and knew that our budget was tight so we agreed to use our tax return to get another used car. Knowing that neither of our other cars would bring anything in for a trade in value we decided we'd have to fix one up and sell it and keep the other one. We set that project aside for a summer yard sale event.
