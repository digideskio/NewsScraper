     <title>Argentina's &quot;Miracle Baby&quot; takes turn for the worse</title>
     <description>
      BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A baby declared stillborn and then later found alive by her parents at a morgue in Argentina was in critical condition on Friday after taking a turn for the worse overnight, a hospital official said. Doctors told Analia Bouter that her baby was stillborn when she gave birth in Argentina's northern Chaco province at the start of the month. But 12 hours after her birth, when Bouter and her husband pried open the wooden coffin inside the refrigerated morgue to see her one last time, they found the baby not only breathing but yawning and stretching her arms. ...

     <title>Argentina's &quot;Miracle Baby&quot; takes turn for the worse</title>
     <description>
