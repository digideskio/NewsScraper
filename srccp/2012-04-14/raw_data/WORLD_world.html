     <description>
      DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan (Reuters) - Nearly 400 prisoners escaped from a jail in northwest Pakistan early on Sunday after it was attacked by Islamist militants armed with guns and rocket propelled grenades, a senior police official said. Some who fled the jail in the town of Bannu, near unruly ethnic Pashtun tribal areas close to the Afghan border, were militants, an intelligence official said. One inmate who escaped was on death row for involvement in an attempt to assassinate former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, a second police official said. ...

     <title>Cuba's allies to boycott future Americas summits</title>
     <description>
      CARTAGENA, Colombia (Reuters) - Cuba's allies in Latin America declared on Saturday that they would stay away from future hemispheric summits if the communist island nation was not invited to attend. Increasing calls to end the ostracism of Cuba was a source of division at this weekend's sixth Summit of the Americas organized by the 34-nation Organization of American Sates (OAS) attended by President Barack Obama.

Some who fled the jail in the town of Bannu, near unruly ethnic Pashtun tribal areas close to the Afghan border, were militants, an intelligence official said.
