     <title>Exceptions to the S&amp;P winning streak rule</title>
     <description>
      It's a pretty reliable winning streak: 17 previous times since 1982, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has gained 10 percent or more in a quarter, and in all but two cases, that has been followed by a gain in the following quarter.

The results beat Wall Street expectations. Investment banking revenue rebounded from the 2011 fourth quarter as fears about the European debt crisis eased, prompting more companies and investors to return to fixed-income and equity markets.

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's risk in commodities trading was a touch higher in the first quarter versus the fourth, as raw materials prices gained slightly on the average, quarterly results on Friday showed. But compared to the first quarter of 2011, risk levels in commodities at the No. 1 U.S. bank were up more than 60 percent.

Alcoa Inc opened the earnings season with a bang, reporting a first-quarter profit on Tuesday instead of the expected loss. That positive surprise foretold a trend.

     <title>Exceptions to the S&amp;P winning streak rule</title>
     <description>
      It's a pretty reliable winning streak: 17 previous times since 1982, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has gained 10 percent or more in a quarter, and in all but two cases, that has been followed by a gain in the following quarter.

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's risk in commodities trading was a touch higher in the first quarter versus the fourth, as raw materials prices gained slightly on the average, quarterly results on Friday showed.
