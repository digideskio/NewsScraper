     <title>Internet smartwatch orders net $2 million for start-up</title>
     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - A Canadian entrepreneur's smartwatch, which works alongside a user's smartphone, has won $2 million worth of orders through an Internet-based funding venture that offers cash-starved companies a way to both test their ideas and raise funds. Eric Migicovsky initially sought $10,000 over a five-week period through Kickstarter (www.kickstarter.com), a website set up to encourage small-scale funding for innovative projects. In just three days, the project has brought in $2.1 million, amounting to orders for almost 17,000 watches at a starting price of $115 each. ...

The Internet giant managed earnings of $10.08 per share on $10.65 billion in revenue, beating analysts EPS estimates of $9.64 and $8.1 billion in sales. Net revenue came in at $8.14 billion after $2.51 billion in traffic acquisition costs, in line with estimates. In the same quarter a year earlier, Google posted&nbsp;an adjusted profit of $8.08 per share $6.5 billion in sales. The company also plans to create a new class of non-voting capital stock that effectively creates a 2-for-1 stock split. The new class C shares will be traded under a separate ticker. “Google had another great quarter with revenues up 24% year on year,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Internet smartwatch orders net $2 million for start-up</title>
     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - A Canadian entrepreneur's smartwatch, which works alongside a user's smartphone, has won $2 million worth of orders through an Internet-based funding venture that offers cash-starved companies a way to both test their ideas and raise funds. Eric Migicovsky initially sought $10,000 over a five-week period through Kickstarter (www.kickstarter.com), a website set up to encourage small-scale funding for innovative projects. In just three days, the project has brought in $2.1 million, amounting to orders for almost 17,000 watches at a starting price of $115 each. ...

The Internet giant managed earnings of $10.08 per share on $10.65 billion in revenue, beating analysts EPS estimates of $9.64 and $8.1 billion in sales. Net revenue came in at $8.14 billion after $2.51 billion in traffic acquisition costs, in line with estimates. In the same quarter a year earlier, Google posted&nbsp;an adjusted profit of $8.08 per share $6.5 billion in sales. The company also plans to create a new class of non-voting capital stock that effectively creates a 2-for-1 stock split. The new class C shares will be traded under a separate ticker. “Google had another great quarter with revenues up 24% year on year,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
