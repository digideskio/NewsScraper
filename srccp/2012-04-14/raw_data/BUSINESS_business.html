Investors were questioning whether the worst sequential slowdown in China's economy since the 2008-09 global financial crisis could enter a sixth quarter after data on Friday revealed the weakest three months of annual growth in three years and a run rate below the official 7.5 percent 2012 target. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland will allow banks to hand over the names of any employees and other third parties who helped wealthy Americans evade taxes to U.S. prosecutors, a Swiss newspaper reported on Saturday. Eleven Swiss banks including Credit Suisse and Julius Baer are under investigation in the United Stated for aiding U.S. citizens suspected of dodging taxes. In the latest attempt to end the long-running dispute, Switzerland's Federal Council has now authorized banks to hand over email traffic in connection with such clients to U.S. prosecutors, the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper reported. ...

The results beat Wall Street expectations. Investment banking revenue rebounded from the 2011 fourth quarter as fears about the European debt crisis eased, prompting more companies and investors to return to fixed-income and equity markets. JPMorgan also got a boost from improvements in credit quality and loan demand - a trend seen in the performance of Wells Fargo &amp; Co as well. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

While lawyers and a board committee are investigating allegations of personal misconduct that led to the abrupt resignation of Best Buy Chief Executive Brian Dunn earlier this week, investors, analysts and retail consultants are focusing on the search for his replacement. They want to see a fresh face at the retailer, which has lost many of its customers to Amazon. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

While lawyers and a board committee are investigating allegations of personal misconduct that led to the abrupt resignation of Best Buy Chief Executive Brian Dunn earlier this week, investors, analysts and retail consultants are focusing on the search for his replacement. They want to see a fresh face at the retailer, which has lost many of its customers to Amazon. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Judge to review moving hundreds of Madoff cases</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the sprawling litigation to recover money related to Bernard Madoff's fraud, a federal judge said he would decide whether a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling prevents a bankruptcy court from resolving hundreds of lawsuits brought by the Madoff firm's trustee. Defendants in those cases have sought to transfer their cases to district court from bankruptcy court, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the estate of former Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith that limited the power of bankruptcy judges to review claims. In an order published Friday, U.S. ...

Blankfein's pay boost includes stock awards from previous years that vested in 2011, and therefore does not reflect the amount that Goldman's board awarded him strictly for the company's performance last year. Goldman offered another figure, $12 million, as the amount Blankfein received for his performance last year. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Blankfein's pay boost includes stock awards from previous years that vested in 2011, and therefore does not reflect the amount that Goldman's board awarded him strictly for the company's performance last year. Goldman offered another figure, $12 million, as the amount Blankfein received for his performance last year. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      (Reuters) - The federal government has asked a court to force Johnson &amp; Johnson executive Alex Gorsky to testify in a lawsuit involving allegations of kickbacks and Medicaid fraud. The U.S. Department of Justice said in Massachusetts federal court filing on Wednesday that Gorsky has &quot;relevant knowledge&quot; concerning the marketing of the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal to long-term care pharmacy Omnicare, Inc and about &quot;allegedly illegal payments J&amp;J made to induce Omnicare to purchase and recommend&quot; the drug. The government sued the company in January 2010. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Friday that the many programs that it, the Federal Reserve and banking authorities implemented during the darkest hours of the 2007-2009 financial crisis likely will end up making a profit for taxpayers. At a background presentation for reporters, a senior Treasury official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the department wanted to get word out about the success of the financial bailout before myths developed about it. ...

     <title>Swiss banks to hand over staff names in U.S. tax row: report</title>
     <description>
      ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland will allow banks to hand over the names of any employees and other third parties who helped wealthy Americans evade taxes to U.S. prosecutors, a Swiss newspaper reported on Saturday. Eleven Swiss banks including Credit Suisse and Julius Baer are under investigation in the United Stated for aiding U.S. citizens suspected of dodging taxes. In the latest attempt to end the long-running dispute, Switzerland's Federal Council has now authorized banks to hand over email traffic in connection with such clients to U.S. prosecutors, the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper reported. ...

The results beat Wall Street expectations. Investment banking revenue rebounded from the 2011 fourth quarter as fears about the European debt crisis eased, prompting more companies and investors to return to fixed-income and equity markets. JPMorgan also got a boost from improvements in credit quality and loan demand - a trend seen in the performance of Wells Fargo &amp; Co as well. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The results beat Wall Street expectations. Investment banking revenue rebounded from the 2011 fourth quarter as fears about the European debt crisis eased, prompting more companies and investors to return to fixed-income and equity markets. JPMorgan also got a boost from improvements in credit quality and loan demand - a trend seen in the performance of Wells Fargo &amp; Co as well. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the sprawling litigation to recover money related to Bernard Madoff's fraud, a federal judge said he would decide whether a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling prevents a bankruptcy court from resolving hundreds of lawsuits brought by the Madoff firm's trustee. Defendants in those cases have sought to transfer their cases to district court from bankruptcy court, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the estate of former Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith that limited the power of bankruptcy judges to review claims. In an order published Friday, U.S. ...

     <title>U.S. sees long-term profit on financial rescue</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Friday that the many programs that it, the Federal Reserve and banking authorities implemented during the darkest hours of the 2007-2009 financial crisis likely will end up making a profit for taxpayers. At a background presentation for reporters, a senior Treasury official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the department wanted to get word out about the success of the financial bailout before myths developed about it. ...

Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. bank and the country's biggest mortgage lender and servicer, said on Friday that net income increased to $4.25 billion, or 75 cents a share, from $3.76 billion, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier.
