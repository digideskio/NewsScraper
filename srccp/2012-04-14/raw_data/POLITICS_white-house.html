The still murky incident involving 16 security personnel and a number of prostitutes in the steamy Caribbean city of Cartagena gave a racey aura to a normally high-minded diplomatic gathering. For the White House, the scandal at the Summit of the Americas added an unwelcome twist to Obama's efforts to win back a region where U.S. influence is steadily waning. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

On a three-day visit to Colombia for a summit with Latin American leaders, Obama is hoping to court Hispanic voters back home whose support could be crucial to him in the November 6 election. The Democratic president wants to fight an impression that he has neglected Latin America and failed to push hard enough on comprehensive immigration reform. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

On a three-day visit to Colombia for a summit with Latin American leaders, Obama is hoping to court Hispanic voters back home whose support could be crucial to him in the November 6 election.
