     <title>A Baby or Breast Cancer, Which is Worse?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | We might all recall a time when we played a game called &quot;What's wrong with this picture?&quot; where we looked at the picture and tired to guess what was out of place.

     <title>Perceptions of cancer care may not match reality</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In a new study, the impressions of breast cancer patients about the quality of care they received often differed from medical definitions of quality -- in part because the patients were judging their experiences by a different set of standards. Patient perceptions are increasingly important to hospitals and other healthcare providers that find their payments from insurers and the government tied to performance and patient evaluations. ...

     <title>Many tests follow surgery for early breast cancer: study</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Women who have early breast tumors surgically removed may often go through repeat mammograms and invasive procedures for years afterwards, with two-thirds having at least one more invasive procedure over the next decade, according to a U.S. study. The study, which covered nearly 3,000 women, focused on so-called ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS - abnormal cells in the milk ducts that are considered the earliest stage of breast cancer. The most common treatment involves removing only the abnormal tissue and conserves the breast. ...

     <title>A Baby or Breast Cancer, Which is Worse?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | We might all recall a time when we played a game called &quot;What's wrong with this picture?&quot; where we looked at the picture and tired to guess what was out of place. The recent &quot;40 Days of Prayer&quot; sponsored by a local chapter of Planned Parenthood certainly fills the bill.

      PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (Reuters) - The Haitian government along with international partners including the World Health Organization launched a vaccination campaign against cholera on Saturday targeting 100,000 people in vulnerable areas of the impoverished Caribbean country. The program was launched in the slum area of Cite de Dieu, in the Haitian capital, where health practitioners are going door-to-door to deliver doses to pre-registered recipients. ...

     <title>Perceptions of cancer care may not match reality</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In a new study, the impressions of breast cancer patients about the quality of care they received often differed from medical definitions of quality -- in part because the patients were judging their experiences by a different set of standards. Patient perceptions are increasingly important to hospitals and other healthcare providers that find their payments from insurers and the government tied to performance and patient evaluations. ...

     <title>Many tests follow surgery for early breast cancer: study</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Women who have early breast tumors surgically removed may often go through repeat mammograms and invasive procedures for years afterwards, with two-thirds having at least one more invasive procedure over the next decade, according to a U.S. study. The study, which covered nearly 3,000 women, focused on so-called ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS - abnormal cells in the milk ducts that are considered the earliest stage of breast cancer. The most common treatment involves removing only the abnormal tissue and conserves the breast. ...
