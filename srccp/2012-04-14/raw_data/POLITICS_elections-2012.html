     <title>Election 2012: Predicting the Latino Vote</title>
     <description>
      The Latino vote will matter in the 2012 election. So say Republicans and Democrats, and even the cover of TIME magazine. But just how much it will matter is not clear at this point. Too many factors remain fluid. We don't know how close races in key states will be, what the Latino and non-Latino turnout will be, or how the vote will split between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.

     <title>Hillary Has Better Things to Do Than Attend the Democratic Convention</title>
     <description>
      In a move that will fuel her current meme-mentum,&nbsp;Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has announced that will be skipping the 2012 Democratic National&nbsp;Convention.&nbsp;“Given her current position, she will not be attending, consistent with her not engaging in any political activity whatsoever,” Philippe Reines, spokesman for the Secretary of State, told The Charlotte Observer, which reports that ethical guidelines and federal statutes preclude Clinton, and some cabinets from participating in anything partisan.&nbsp;

     <description>
      One of the biggest advocates of controversial antipiracy legislation finds himself in the political fight of his life. But Rep. Howard Berman’s career is not in peril because of his stalwart support for the Stop Online Piracy Act -- which was strongly backed by movie studios, record companies, and other content creators and opposed with equal fervor by tech firms and Internet activists.

     <description>
      The Latino vote will matter in the 2012 election. So say Republicans and Democrats, and even the cover of TIME magazine. But just how much it will matter is not clear at this point.

     <title>Hillary Has Better Things to Do Than Attend the Democratic Convention</title>
     <description>
      In a move that will fuel her current meme-mentum,&nbsp;Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has announced that will be skipping the 2012 Democratic National&nbsp;Convention.&nbsp;“Given her current position, she will not be attending, consistent with her not engaging in any political activity whatsoever,” Philippe Reines, spokesman for the Secretary of State, told The Charlotte Observer, which reports that ethical guidelines and federal statutes preclude Clinton, and some cabinets from participating in anything partisan.&nbsp;

     <title>As Hollywood Watches, SOPA Champion Berman Fights for His Seat</title>
     <description>
      One of the biggest advocates of controversial antipiracy legislation finds himself in the political fight of his life. But Rep. Howard Berman’s career is not in peril because of his stalwart support for the Stop Online Piracy Act -- which was strongly backed by movie studios, record companies, and other content creators and opposed with equal fervor by tech firms and Internet activists.

A perusal of their job board turns up a slew of positions located in &quot;HQ Digital,&quot; ranging from front end developer to senior web engineer. ...
