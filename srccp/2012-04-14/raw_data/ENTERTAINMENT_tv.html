     <title>Roger Ailes takes dig at Soledad O'Brien's name</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Roger Ailes probably should probably hire a new joke writer. The Fox News president made headlines Friday after taking an inexplicable -- and not particularly witty -- dig at CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien. The comment came during an appearance at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday. Ailes was on campus as part of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication's Roy H. Park Distinguished Lecture Series, but one particular comment from Ailes wasn't particularly distinguished at all. ...

     <title>&quot;Flintstones&quot; reboot put on indefinite hold</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Sorry, Seth MacFarlane fans: when it comes to his planned &quot;Flintstones&quot; reboot, the operative phrase is now, &quot;Yabba Dabba Don't.&quot; The revamp of the classic cartoon about a prehistoric working schlub and his family, which was to air on Fox, has been put on ice indefinitely, due to schedule concerns on MacFarlane's part. Fox announced the series last May with a plan to premiere the new &quot;Flintstones&quot; in 2013. Though the news may disappoint, it's hardly surprising that MacFarlane should find his plate too full. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - A lot of junk will be purchased and hauled across the country on A&amp;E this summer, as the network has ordered new, 26-episode seasons of its hit reality shows &quot;Storage Wars,&quot; &quot;Storage Wars: Texas&quot; and &quot;Shipping Wars.&quot; All three shows will premiere their latest seasons this summer. &quot;Storage Wars,&quot; which debuted in 2010 and has become the cable network's highest-rated series, follows the adventures of a group of auction hunters.

The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday, claims that DelVecchio and his company, Blowout Enterprises, entered into a representation agreement in January 2010 - shortly after &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; premiered on MTV. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Roger Ailes takes dig at Soledad O'Brien's name</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Roger Ailes probably should probably hire a new joke writer. The Fox News president made headlines Friday after taking an inexplicable -- and not particularly witty -- dig at CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien. The comment came during an appearance at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday. Ailes was on campus as part of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication's Roy H. Park Distinguished Lecture Series, but one particular comment from Ailes wasn't particularly distinguished at all. ...

     <title>&quot;Flintstones&quot; reboot put on indefinite hold</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Sorry, Seth MacFarlane fans: when it comes to his planned &quot;Flintstones&quot; reboot, the operative phrase is now, &quot;Yabba Dabba Don't.&quot; The revamp of the classic cartoon about a prehistoric working schlub and his family, which was to air on Fox, has been put on ice indefinitely, due to schedule concerns on MacFarlane's part. Fox announced the series last May with a plan to premiere the new &quot;Flintstones&quot; in 2013. Though the news may disappoint, it's hardly surprising that MacFarlane should find his plate too full. ...

Household incomes in the country have stagnated in recent years, but cable, satellite and telco bills have not.
