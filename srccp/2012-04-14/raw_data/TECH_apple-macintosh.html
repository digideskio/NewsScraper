In a major embarrassment for Washington at the Summit of the Americas attended by more than 30 heads of state, 11 U.S. Secret Service agents were sent home and five military servicemen grounded over &quot;misconduct&quot; allegations in a hotel. Prostitutes were taken to the hotel, according to a Colombian police source. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

With threats of war hanging over an already unsettled Middle East, U.S. and other Western diplomats welcomed their Iranian counterparts willingness in Istanbul on Saturday to discuss their nuclear activities - something they had refused since early last year. But though they will meet again, in Baghdad on May 23, they remained poles apart. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

In an interview conducted on Friday and released on Saturday, an anchor for the Spanish-language network noted Obama had released his tax returns for 12 years and asked him if Romney should do the same. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

In a major embarrassment for Washington at the Summit of the Americas attended by more than 30 heads of state, 11 U.S. Secret Service agents were sent home and five military servicemen grounded over &quot;misconduct&quot; allegations in a hotel.

With threats of war hanging over an already unsettled Middle East, U.S. and other Western diplomats welcomed their Iranian counterparts willingness in Istanbul on Saturday to discuss their nuclear activities - something they had refused since early last year. But though they will meet again, in Baghdad on May 23, they remained poles apart. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

A jowly Kim Jong-un, clad in black and the third of his line to rule North Korea, read monotonously from a script in Pyongyang's central square after goose-stepping soldiers and sailors showcased the North's military power in a parade in spring sunlight. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
