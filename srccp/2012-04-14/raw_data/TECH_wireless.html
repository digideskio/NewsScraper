     <title>Mel Gibson, Wrecker of Totem Polls; The Man With the Golden Hands</title>
     <description>
      We realize there's only so much time one can spend in a day watching new trailers, viral video clips, and shaky cell phone footage of people arguing on live television. This is why every day The Atlantic Wire highlights the videos that truly earn your five minutes (or less) of attention. Today: Joe Estzerhas says Mel Gibson is, among other things, a totem poll breaker, the rise and fall of a Hollywood hand model, and Michael Bloomberg and Miss Piggy liven up the Friday news cycle.

     <title>How to Avoid the New Android Malware (and Defective Apps)</title>
     <description>
      According to NQ Mobile Security Research Center, more than 160,000 Android phone owners were affected by malware called UpdtBot, which spreads itself via text messages telling people to download a software update. UpdtBot appears to be mostly in China, but even in English-speaking countries thousands of people have so far been fooled by a fake app that doesn't do what it claims to, and there are several more on the Google Play store.

The regional court in the city of Mannheim confirmed an earlier ruling that Apple owes Motorola for using a patented technology that automatically informs Apple customers about their new messages on iPhones, iPods or iPads. A court spokesman said Apple still had to refrain from offering the &quot;push&quot; features in Germany, that it was liable for damages and was ordered to provide information to calculate the amount of damages. ...

     <title>Asus, Samsung Bringing Sub-$400 Tablets This Month</title>
     <description>
      Apple's strategy for low-end iPhone and iPads is simple: Last year's model is still on sale this year, but at a discount. And while the original iPad was priced more aggressively than any of Apple's competitors could keep up with at the time, at $499, the 2011 iPad 2 pushes that price tag down even farther, becoming this year's low-end model at $399. That raises (or lowers) the bar for any Android tablet manufacturer trying to compete, especially when none can equal the new iPad's Retina Display or the number and quality of tablet apps on the iTunes App Store.

This is why every day The Atlantic Wire highlights the videos that truly earn your five minutes (or less) of attention. Today: Joe Estzerhas says Mel Gibson is, among other things, a totem poll breaker, the rise and fall of a Hollywood hand model, and Michael Bloomberg and Miss Piggy liven up the Friday news cycle.

     <title>How to Avoid the New Android Malware (and Defective Apps)</title>
     <description>
      According to NQ Mobile Security Research Center, more than 160,000 Android phone owners were affected by malware called UpdtBot, which spreads itself via text messages telling people to download a software update. UpdtBot appears to be mostly in China, but even in English-speaking countries thousands of people have so far been fooled by a fake app that doesn't do what it claims to, and there are several more on the Google Play store.

     <title>German court upholds ban on Apple &quot;push&quot; email</title>
     <description>
      FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A German court on Friday upheld a ban on &quot;push&quot; emails in Apple's iCloud and MobileMe services in Germany, ruling in favor of rival Motorola Mobility. The regional court in the city of Mannheim confirmed an earlier ruling that Apple owes Motorola for using a patented technology that automatically informs Apple customers about their new messages on iPhones, iPods or iPads. A court spokesman said Apple still had to refrain from offering the &quot;push&quot; features in Germany, that it was liable for damages and was ordered to provide information to calculate the amount of damages. ...

     <title>Asus, Samsung Bringing Sub-$400 Tablets This Month</title>
     <description>
      Apple's strategy for low-end iPhone and iPads is simple: Last year's model is still on sale this year, but at a discount. And while the original iPad was priced more aggressively than any of Apple's competitors could keep up with at the time, at $499, the 2011 iPad 2 pushes that price tag down even farther, becoming this year's low-end model at $399. That raises (or lowers) the bar for any Android tablet manufacturer trying to compete, especially when none can equal the new iPad's Retina Display or the number and quality of tablet apps on the iTunes App Store.

The event is scheduled for Wednesday, April 18th, about a week before the handset is rumored to launch on April 25th. HTC unveiled the One S alongside the One X at the Mobile World Congress trade show in February. The device features a 4.3-inch qHD Super LCD display, a dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor clocked at 1.5GHz, 16GB of internal storage, the same stunning 8-megapixel camera found on the One X and Sense 4.0 atop Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
