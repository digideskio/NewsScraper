     <title>Texas OKs experimental stem cell therapy rules</title>
     <description>
      The Texas Medical Board on Friday approved new rules on experimental stem cell therapies such as the one Gov. Rick Perry underwent during back surgery last year, despite objections they don't do enough to protect patients and could led to an explosion of doctors promoting unproven, expensive treatments.

     <title>Gene Discovery May Move Personalized Stomach Cancer Treatment Forward</title>
     <description>
      SUNDAY, April 8 (HealthDay News) -- An international team of researchers has identified hundreds of new genes that are mutated in stomach cancer, in a finding they say could lead to treatments tailored to the genetic make-up of individual stomach tumors.

     <title>Researchers Find Gene Mutations That May Be a Key to Autism</title>
     <description>
      WEDNESDAY, April 4 (HealthDay News) -- Genetic mutations that arise spontaneously, as opposed to being passed through generations, could play an important role in the development of autism, new research suggests.

     <title>Gene studies begin to unravel autism puzzle</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - A sweeping study of hundreds of families with autism has found that spontaneous mutations can occur in a parent's sperm or egg cells that increase a child's risk for autism, and fathers are four times more likely than mothers to pass these mutations on to their children, researchers said on Wednesday. The results of three new studies, published in the journal Nature, suggest mutations in parts of genes that code for proteins - called the exome - play a significant role in autism. ...

The Myriad case has been closely watched by the biotechnology industry, with some insiders suggesting that a ruling against gene patenting could have a devastating effect on future innovation. ...

     <title>Homeless killer suspect said he had 'killer' gene</title>
     <description>
      A former Marine charged with the gory stabbing deaths of six people in California told investigators he targeted homeless people in part because they were vulnerable, and that he believes he has a &quot;killer gene,&quot; according to court papers obtained Thursday.

     <title>Texas OKs experimental stem cell therapy rules</title>
     <description>
      The Texas Medical Board on Friday approved new rules on experimental stem cell therapies such as the one Gov. Rick Perry underwent during back surgery last year, despite objections they don't do enough to protect patients and could led to an explosion of doctors promoting unproven, expensive treatments.

     <title>Gene Discovery May Move Personalized Stomach Cancer Treatment Forward</title>
     <description>
      SUNDAY, April 8 (HealthDay News) -- An international team of researchers has identified hundreds of new genes that are mutated in stomach cancer, in a finding they say could lead to treatments tailored to the genetic make-up of individual stomach tumors.

     <title>Researchers Find Gene Mutations That May Be a Key to Autism</title>
     <description>
      WEDNESDAY, April 4 (HealthDay News) -- Genetic mutations that arise spontaneously, as opposed to being passed through generations, could play an important role in the development of autism, new research suggests.

     <title>Gene studies begin to unravel autism puzzle</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - A sweeping study of hundreds of families with autism has found that spontaneous mutations can occur in a parent's sperm or egg cells that increase a child's risk for autism, and fathers are four times more likely than mothers to pass these mutations on to their children, researchers said on Wednesday. The results of three new studies, published in the journal Nature, suggest mutations in parts of genes that code for proteins - called the exome - play a significant role in autism. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court set aside on Monday a ruling that Myriad Genetics Inc can patent two genes linked to breast and ovarian cancers, in a case closely watched by the biotechnology industry. The justices set aside a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that Myriad has the right to patent two human genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, that account for most inherited forms of breast and ovarian cancers, and sent the matter back for more proceedings. ...

     <title>Scientists find gene that can make flu a killer</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - A genetic discovery could help explain why flu makes some people seriously ill or kills them, while others seem able to bat it away with little more than a few aches, coughs and sneezes. In a study published in the journal Nature on Sunday, British and American researchers said they had found for the first time a human gene that influences how people respond to flu infections, making some people more susceptible than others. ...

     <title>Stem cells from fat win favor with heart researcher</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - Stem cells derived from a patient's bone marrow can help treat severe heart failure, but the results are even better when they are taken from fat, a leading researcher said, citing his experience in a number of studies. &quot;It's no longer a question whether the bone marrow cells work or don't work; they do work when you have healthy stem cells,&quot; Dr. James Willerson of the Texas Heart Institute said in an interview. &quot;The search now is to find the very best stem cell type or types. ...

     <description>
      A former Marine charged with the gory stabbing deaths of six people in California told investigators he targeted homeless people in part because they were vulnerable, and that he believes he has a &quot;killer gene,&quot; according to court papers obtained Thursday.
