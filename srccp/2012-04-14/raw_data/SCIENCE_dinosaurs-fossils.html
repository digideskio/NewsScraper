     <title>Ice age data bolsters greenhouse gas, warming link</title>
     <description>
      The dramatic temperature increases that thawed the last ice age followed spikes in carbon dioxide levels in the air, a new study finds. Researchers say that further strengthens the scientific case explaining current man-made global warming.

     <title>When Dinosaurs Roamed, Wildfire Was a Foe</title>
     <description>
      Fierce dinosaurs may not have had to contend with many predators, but intense and frequent wildfires may have been a real threat during their reign, new research suggests. Wildfires seem to have left their mark on the archeological record in the form of charcoal deposits.

     <title>April Fools! 5 Hilarious Fake Scientific Breakthroughs</title>
     <description>
      Scientists and science journals are at an advantage when it comes to fooling the rest of the world on April 1. For one thing, the average reader is optimistic, and therefore liable to believe anything amazing when it comes to scientific discoveries. Secondly, no one expects a stereotypically dry, robotic scientist to pull a prank.

Global temperatures and the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were similar to today's climate, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Skull Confirms Older Origin for 'Living Fossil' Fish</title>

      Fierce dinosaurs may not have had to contend with many predators, but intense and frequent wildfires may have been a real threat during their reign, new research suggests. Wildfires seem to have left their mark on the archeological record in the form of charcoal deposits.

     <title>April Fools! 5 Hilarious Fake Scientific Breakthroughs</title>
     <description>
      Scientists and science journals are at an advantage when it comes to fooling the rest of the world on April 1. For one thing, the average reader is optimistic, and therefore liable to believe anything amazing when it comes to scientific discoveries. Secondly, no one expects a stereotypically dry, robotic scientist to pull a prank.
