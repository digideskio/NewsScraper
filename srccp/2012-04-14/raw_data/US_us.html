     <description>
      (Reuters) - One of two white Oklahoma men charged with murder and hate crimes over accusations of shooting dead three black people and wounding two said in an interview from jail on Saturday that he felt no hatred or ill-will toward African-Americans. Prosecutors brought murder and hate crime charges on Friday against 19-year-old Jake England, who was arrested with Alvin Watts, 33.

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Five members of the U.S. military assigned to support the Secret Service during President Barack Obama's visit to Colombia violated curfew and may have been involved in &quot;inappropriate conduct,&quot; the U.S. Southern Command said on Saturday. One day after the U.S. Secret Service said it had sent some agents home from Cartagena for allegations of misconduct - which Colombian police said involved prostitutes - the Southern Command said it was punishing military members involved in &quot;inappropriate conduct&quot; at the same hotel in which the agents had stayed. ...

     <title>Some Washington state churches in split over gay marriage</title>
     <description>
      SEATTLE (Reuters) - A handful of Roman Catholic churches in Washington state, whose Catholic governor signed a law allowing gay marriage earlier this year, have refused to circulate a petition endorsed by their archbishop to repeal the law, congregation leaders said. Opponents of same-sex marriage, due to go into effect this summer in the state, have been rallying conservative religious leaders to gather the 120,577 signatures they need by June 6 to secure a spot on the November 2012 ballot for their repeal push. A bulletin from Seattle Archbishop J. ...

      SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Two crosses on a mountaintop in a California military base have touched off a fight between U.S. troops and veterans opposed to religious symbols on public lands and the families of slain Marines who set up the display. The two 13-foot (4-meter) crosses stand 3,000 feet above sea level on the dry and scrub-covered Mount San Onofre at Camp Pendleton, in the far northwest part of the Marine Corps base near San Diego. ...

     <description>
      DENVER (Reuters) - The leader of a Mexican drug cartel was sentenced on Friday to more than 22 years in prison by a federal judge in Colorado, who said the kingpin's criminal enterprise sold $1 billion worth of cocaine in eight U.S. states. Oscar Arriola, 43, was &quot;a clear and present danger to this country and its citizens,&quot; U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn said. The cartel distributed cocaine in 2002 and 2003 in New York, Illinois, Georgia and five other states from a storage center at a Colorado ranch, before an anonymous tip led to an investigation, the U.S. ...

     <description>
      CARTAGENA, Colombia (Reuters) - U.S. Secret Service agents and soldiers tasked with protecting President Barack Obama at a summit in Colombia have instead embarrassed the United States by cavorting with prostitutes. The still murky incident involving 16 security personnel and a number of prostitutes in the steamy Caribbean city of Cartagena gave a racey aura to a normally high-minded diplomatic gathering. For the White House, the scandal at the Summit of the Americas added an unwelcome twist to Obama's efforts to win back a region where U.S. influence is steadily waning. ...

      SEATTLE (Reuters) - A handful of Roman Catholic churches in Washington state, whose Catholic governor signed a law allowing gay marriage earlier this year, have refused to circulate a petition endorsed by their archbishop to repeal the law, congregation leaders said. Opponents of same-sex marriage, due to go into effect this summer in the state, have been rallying conservative religious leaders to gather the 120,577 signatures they need by June 6 to secure a spot on the November 2012 ballot for their repeal push.

     <description>
      (Reuters) - One of two white Oklahoma men charged with murder and hate crimes over accusations of shooting dead three black people and wounding two said in an interview from jail on Saturday that he felt no hatred or ill-will toward African-Americans. Prosecutors brought murder and hate crime charges on Friday against 19-year-old Jake England, who was arrested with Alvin Watts, 33.

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Five members of the U.S. military assigned to support the Secret Service during President Barack Obama's visit to Colombia violated curfew and may have been involved in &quot;inappropriate conduct,&quot; the U.S. Southern Command said on Saturday. One day after the U.S. Secret Service said it had sent some agents home from Cartagena for allegations of misconduct - which Colombian police said involved prostitutes - the Southern Command said it was punishing military members involved in &quot;inappropriate conduct&quot; at the same hotel in which the agents had stayed. ...

     <title>Some Washington state churches in split over gay marriage</title>
     <description>
      SEATTLE (Reuters) - A handful of Roman Catholic churches in Washington state, whose Catholic governor signed a law allowing gay marriage earlier this year, have refused to circulate a petition endorsed by their archbishop to repeal the law, congregation leaders said. Opponents of same-sex marriage, due to go into effect this summer in the state, have been rallying conservative religious leaders to gather the 120,577 signatures they need by June 6 to secure a spot on the November 2012 ballot for their repeal push. A bulletin from Seattle Archbishop J. ...

      SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Two crosses on a mountaintop in a California military base have touched off a fight between U.S. troops and veterans opposed to religious symbols on public lands and the families of slain Marines who set up the display. The two 13-foot (4-meter) crosses stand 3,000 feet above sea level on the dry and scrub-covered Mount San Onofre at Camp Pendleton, in the far northwest part of the Marine Corps base near San Diego. ...

     <description>
      DENVER (Reuters) - The leader of a Mexican drug cartel was sentenced on Friday to more than 22 years in prison by a federal judge in Colorado, who said the kingpin's criminal enterprise sold $1 billion worth of cocaine in eight U.S. states. Oscar Arriola, 43, was &quot;a clear and present danger to this country and its citizens,&quot; U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn said. The cartel distributed cocaine in 2002 and 2003 in New York, Illinois, Georgia and five other states from a storage center at a Colorado ranch, before an anonymous tip led to an investigation, the U.S. ...

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of sexual assault cases reported to U.S. military authorities edged up last year, with most involving a member of the armed forces attacking another, the Pentagon said in an annual report released on Friday. The 3,192 cases in 2011 amounted to a 1 percent increase over the 3,158 reported in 2010. Some 56 percent of the cases involved one service member attacking another, 26 percent a member of the military attacking a civilian, 6 percent a civilian attacking a service member and 12 percent an unidentified person attacking a service member, the report said. ...

     <title>Judge to review moving hundreds of Madoff cases</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the sprawling litigation to recover money related to Bernard Madoff's fraud, a federal judge said he would decide whether a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling prevents a bankruptcy court from resolving hundreds of lawsuits brought by the Madoff firm's trustee. Defendants in those cases have sought to transfer their cases to district court from bankruptcy court, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the estate of former Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith that limited the power of bankruptcy judges to review claims. In an order published Friday, U.S. ...

     <description>
      CARTAGENA, Colombia (Reuters) - U.S. Secret Service agents and soldiers tasked with protecting President Barack Obama at a summit in Colombia have instead embarrassed the United States by cavorting with prostitutes. The still murky incident involving 16 security personnel and a number of prostitutes in the steamy Caribbean city of Cartagena gave a racey aura to a normally high-minded diplomatic gathering. For the White House, the scandal at the Summit of the Americas added an unwelcome twist to Obama's efforts to win back a region where U.S. influence is steadily waning. ...
