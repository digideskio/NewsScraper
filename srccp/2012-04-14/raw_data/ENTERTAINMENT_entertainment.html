Spain's King Juan Carlos has successfully undergone hip replacement surgery to repair minor damage related to arthritis worsened by a fall, his fourth operation in less than two years, royal palace officials said Saturday April 14, 2012. Leading newspaper El Pais reported on its website that the king had been on an elephant hunting trip when the fall occurred, but the palace declined to comment, saying the visit was a private matter. This is not the first time the aging monarch's love of hunting has caused concern. In October 2006, a Russian governor launched an inquiry into reports that Juan Carlos had shot and killed a bear while on holiday near Moscow.

Spain's King Juan Carlos has successfully undergone hip replacement surgery to repair minor damage related to arthritis worsened by a fall, his fourth operation in less than two years, royal palace officials said Saturday April 14, 2012. Leading newspaper El Pais reported on its website that the king had been on an elephant hunting trip when the fall occurred, but the palace declined to comment, saying the visit was a private matter. This is not the first time the aging monarch's love of hunting has caused concern. In October 2006, a Russian governor launched an inquiry into reports that Juan Carlos had shot and killed a bear while on holiday near Moscow.
