     <title>Web privacy rules turn poachers into gamekeepers</title>
     <description>
      BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When you 'like' something on Facebook or read an online newspaper, perhaps a dozen or more companies are squirreling away data on your tastes, your habits, whether you're male or female, old or young, gay or straight. They mean no harm. They just want to give you, the customer, exactly what you want - it's the grandfather of all business slogans. Their dilemma, now regulators' noses are twitching, is how to serve you, and serve themselves, when what you want is to be left alone. ...

     <title>Senior Is Eager To Prevent Life From Going To The Dogs</title>
     <description>
      DEAR ABBY: I'm a 17-year-old senior with a single, very controlling mother. It's impossible to have a sit-down conversation with her because she's always working to support us. She works as a dog groomer. She's always polite to her customers and friends, but she turns into a witch when it's just her and us kids.I have never had any freedom. I go to school, come home and groom dogs, then it's the same cycle all over again. She makes me feel useless unless I'm working for her, and the truth is I think she wants me to live with her forever. ...
