     <title>Republic of Fear</title>
     <description>
      Barack Obama looked improbably younger then, before the strains of the Oval Office began to fully settle into his features. After only four months as commander in chief, he was prepared to end the “season of fear,” as he put it. It had been a reactionary period when the government made well-intentioned but hasty decisions based on alarm about another attack rather than foresight. U.S. officials and a compliant Congress had determined that antiterrorism ends justified nearly any means. Americans had abandoned cherished values as luxuries that they suddenly could no longer afford. ...

     <title>Student loan rate extension opposed by conservative groups like Club for Growth</title>
     <description>
      Pushing back on an aggressive campaign from Democrats and the White House for Congress to extend the temporary low interest rate for federally subsidized student loans, conservative groups are pressuring Republicans to kill the Interest Rate Reduction Act, which would keep the interest rate from doubling to 6.8 percent this year. The Club for Growth [...]

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed a cybersecurity bill on Thursday that would allow the government and companies to share information about hacking, but which has raised privacy concerns and a veto threat from the White House. The House approved the bill 248-168, prompting the top Republican and Democrat on the intelligence committee who sponsored it to issue a joint statement lauding the bipartisan approval. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Secret Service is examining a new report of alleged misconduct by agents at an El Salvador strip club ahead of a trip there last year by President Barack Obama, senior lawmakers said on Thursday. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan is looking into the report but has so far not found anything &quot;credible&quot; to back it up, Representative Elijah Cummings told reporters outside the U.S. House of Representatives. Cummings is the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ...

     <title>Politics Goes Postal with Dueling Reform Bills</title>
     <description>
      The Washington Post reports the Senate has passed legislation that would save the U.S. Postal Service from its near-collapse. If a deal to cut expenses isn't reached by May 15, the postal agency will start closing more facilities unless Congress passes laws otherwise. The American institution is trying to save expenses as the amount of mail being delivered has decreased steadily over the past decade.
