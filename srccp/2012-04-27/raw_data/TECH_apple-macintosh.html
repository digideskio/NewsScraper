Lester Jr. during a bond hearing in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman's attorney says his client's bail might have been higher if a judge had known about $200,000 raised by a website. Mark O'Mara said on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 that he only learned about the money Wednesday and will inform a judge at a hearing Friday, April 28, 2012. Friday's hearing was initially scheduled to deal with several media organizations, including The Associated Press, asking the judge to unseal documents from Zimmerman's court file.
