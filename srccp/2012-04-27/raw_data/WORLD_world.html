     <title>Chavez ally raises specter of opposition violence</title>
     <description>
      LOS TEQUES, Venezuela (Reuters) - President Hugo Chavez's big poll lead puts him in a strong position ahead of Venezuela's presidential election, but it could also convince radical opponents violence is the only way to beat him, a senior campaign strategist said. Despite ongoing cancer treatment, Chavez is favored to extend his 13-year rule at the October 7 vote, with most opinion polls giving him an advantage of at least 10 percentage points over opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. ...

     <title>Mali junta rejects West African troop deployment</title>
     <description>
      DAKAR (Reuters) - Mali's junta said on Friday it would resist any deployment of West African soldiers in the country and treat foreign forces sent there under a regional plan as &quot;the enemy&quot;. The comments came a day after regional bloc ECOWAS said it would send troops to Mali and Guinea-Bissau to tackle the aftermath of coups that, in the case of Mali, has left more than half the country in rebel hands. &quot;We will not accept any ECOWAS soldiers on our territory. This is non-negotiable. ...

Both South Sudan, which seceded from Sudan and became independent last July, and Sudan claim the Heglig oilfield.
