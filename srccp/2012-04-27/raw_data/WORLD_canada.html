     <title>Canada seeks C$900 million or more in spectrum auction</title>
     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada aims to raise a minimum of nearly C$900 million through an auction of valuable wireless spectrum, based on ground rules published by the government this week, though the sale could bring in far more as carriers vie for the frequencies. The online document spelling out the rules marks the start of a months-long consultation process that will bed down the finer points of an auction that will shape the wireless industry for years to come. The sale is scheduled for early next year. ...

     <title>Canada offers more transparency on takeover rules</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - The Canadian government promised on Friday to make its reviews of foreign takeovers more transparent, allowing it to explain when it has concerns about a proposed investment and perhaps even saying why. A government statement said Canada will change the way it reviews foreign investments, a nod to those who have complained about opaque rules that allow the government to block takeovers that it does not think will provide a net benefit to Canada. ...

The Department of Finance's monthly fiscal monitor showed a surplus of C$1.48 billion in February. That compares with a deficit of C$592 million in the same month last year.

     <title>TransCanada profit falls on low natural gas prices</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp, Canada's biggest pipeline company, reported a 14 percent drop in first-quarter profit mainly due to a very warm winter and abysmally low natural gas prices. TransCanada, which is involved in building the southern leg of the Canada-Texas Keystone XL oil pipeline, said net income attributable to common shares fell to C$352 million ($357.7 million), or 50 Canadian cents per share, from C$411 million, or 59 Canadian cents per share, a year ago. ...

     <title>Pension plans launch $20 billion infrastructure fund</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - One of Canada's largest pension plans teamed up on Thursday with Japan's pension funds and some of its major conglomerates to help raise $20 billion for the world's largest infrastructure fund to invest in assets such as roads and airports. While a handful of the world's biggest pension funds have the capacity to lead their own investments in infrastructure assets, the initiative represents an unprecedented effort to cut out asset managers as middle men in infrastructure investment. ...

     <description>
      OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - The end of a long legal battle over whether Globalive's foreign backing precluded it from offering wireless service in Canada opens the door for the company to amass more foreign cash ahead of an auction of airwaves next year, its chief executive said. Canada's Supreme Court declined on Thursday to hear a challenge to a government decision to allow Globalive to operate in Canada despite close ties to a foreign company, initially Egypt's Orascom Telecom Holding SAE but now Russia's Vimpelcom Ltd. ...

The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) said on Friday its recently launched MLS Home Price Index rose to 152.9 last month, a 1.3 percent rise from February and a 5.1 percent gain from March 2011. The index had also risen at a 5.1 percent annual pace in February, the smallest increase since June. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
