     <title>Rate of Statin-Linked Muscle Woes Unclear, Study Suggests</title>
     <description>
      FRIDAY, April 27 (HealthDay News) -- It's been long known that people on high doses of statins, cholesterol-lowering medications taken by millions of Americans, are at risk for a rare yet serious muscle condition. However, new research suggests that the frequency of the condition, called rhabdomyolysis, is a bit less clear due to confusion with the codes health professionals use to classify and report such problems.

     <title>FDA rejects Amgen's application for Xgeva</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators rejected the application by Amgen Inc, the world's biggest biotechnology company, to expand the use of the drug Xgeva to delay the spread of tumors to the bone in patients suffering from advanced prostate cancer. Xgeva and a related osteoporosis drug Prolia are seen as among the most important growth drivers for Amgen and may help offset declining sales of anemia drugs, analysts say. ...
