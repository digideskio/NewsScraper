     <description>

Digby Ioane returned from a five-week ban to celebrate his 50th game for Queensland with a try in the second minute, while team mates Luke Morahan and Dom Shipperley also crossed on a drizzly night at Auckland's Eden Park. After charging to a 12-0 lead in the first eight minutes, the Reds were held to 15-8 at halftime, but their well-marshalled defence put paid to a second-half fightback by the Blues, who slumped to their eighth loss in nine matches. ...

     <title>Chanderpaul reaches elite group as Australia seize control</title>
     <description>
      ROSEAU, Dominica (Reuters) - Shivnarine Chanderpaul became the 10th batsman to reach 10,000 test runs as he headed West Indies' attempt to avoid defeat in the third and final test against Australia on Thursday. Set a daunting target of 370 to win on a track offering plenty for spin, as West Indian Shane Shillingford proved with his 10-wicket haul, the home side fought hard with Chanderpaul making a typically stubborn 69 from 122 balls in his team's 173 for five. ...
