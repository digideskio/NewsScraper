      NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York prosecutors are looking into possible financial mismanagement at Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf after lawyers at the law firm requested an investigation, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf, a major U.S. law firm, has lost some 70 of its 300 partners since the beginning of the year. The defections, coupled with debt, have left the firm struggling to stay afloat. ...

     <title>Illinois to test investor appetite with $1.8 billion deal</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Illinois will see next week if yield-hungry investors will continue to snap up its bonds despite concerns about its huge unfunded pension liability and structural budget deficit. The state will sell about $1.8 billion of general obligation refunding bonds through Jefferies &amp; Co on Tuesday, adding to the $1.375 billion of debt it sold in the first quarter. Illinois' last sale of $500 million of GO bonds in March attracted orders for $2.3 billion, allowing the state to boost the size of the deal and cut yields. ...

     <title>Minneapolis airport scare was false alarm</title>
     <description>
      MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - A bomb scare that shut a terminal at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport for 90 minutes on Friday morning was caused by a passenger carrying what he said was a water filtration system in his checked baggage, an official said. Police questioned and released the man without charges after the materials were determined to not be explosive, airport spokesman Patrick Hogan said. He declined to identify the man because he was not charged. &quot;The questionable items in the bag were two PVC pipes capped at both ends filled with a granular material,&quot; Hogan said. ...

     <title>Radioactive waste dump opens in Texas, environmentalists worried</title>
     <description>
      SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) - A 1,300-acre dump to bury low-level radioactive waste has opened in a remote corner of west Texas, the fourth U.S. site to allow such waste, despite concerns about water seepage at the site, which sits above the huge and vital Ogallala aquifer. In a letter to Waste Control Specialists LLC of Dallas, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality granted approval to the company's dump near Andrews, Texas, about 45 miles northwest of Midland and close to the New Mexico border. ...

     <title>Campaign treasurer for NYC comptroller indicted</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - The campaign treasurer for New York City Comptroller John Liu has been indicted for making a false statement to federal officials, according to a court filing, further weakening Liu's bid to become mayor in 2013. In February, Liu's campaign treasurer, Jia Hou, was arrested and charged with fraud for violating contribution limits. Prosecutors said she had used &quot;straw donors&quot; to funnel large, illegal contributions to Liu's mayoral campaign. Straw donors make a campaign contribution in their own names but with funds provided by someone else, or are reimbursed for the donation later. ...

Adams herded two female employees of the store, Candace Driver and Nikki Dement, along with Kenneth Vandever, who was described as having mental disabilities and who did odd jobs around the store, into Driver's car, according to court documents. ...

     <description>
      SEATTLE (Reuters) - The Border Patrol is unjustifiably stopping people based on their skin color in Washington state's Olympic Peninsula, just across the water from Canada, the American Civil Liberties Union said in a lawsuit filed on Thursday. Two Latinos and a black man - two of them prison corrections officers - said in the complaint filed in U.S. federal court in Seattle that they were subject to racial profiling. One of the officers was in his uniform when he was stopped, the lawsuit said. The accusations against the U.S. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Workers curbed a natural-gas leak from a stricken Chesapeake Energy Corp. well in Wyoming about three days after a blowout, the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commission said on Friday. Boots and Coots, a pressure control company owned by Houston-based Halliburton and contracted by Chesapeake after the well blowout on Tuesday, was pumping drilling mud into the well a day after its efforts were hampered by wind and adverse weather. The well stopped leaking natural gas about three days after Chesapeake lost control while installing a well casing, the Commission said. ...

      LOUISVILLE, Ky (Reuters) - A Kentucky judge ordered state officials to consider using a single drug to carry out executions instead of a series of three drugs used by many states where the death penalty is legal. The judge's ruling on Wednesday was handed down on the same day that a controversy erupted over the execution of a man in Arizona using a single drug. Thomas Kemp was put to death in Arizona on Wednesday using the single drug pentobarbital. ...

U.S. Navy SEALs shot bin Laden last year in a raid on the al Qaeda leader's compound in Pakistan before dawn on May 2 local time, which was May 1 in the United States. The killing is touted by the Obama administration as one of its top national security accomplishments. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      EDINBURG, Texas (Reuters) - Deputies arrested a purported &quot;kingpin of cockfighting&quot; who they said profited off a Texas cockfighting ring that was the scene of an ambush last week where masked gunmen killed three men and wounded eight others, the local sheriff said on Thursday. Guadalupe Garza Herrera, who owns a chain of transmission repair shops in South Texas, was arrested and charged with cockfighting and engaging in organized criminal activity. Garza Herrera, 41, doubled as the &quot;kingpin of cockfighting&quot; locally, Sheriff Lupe Trevino said. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German analysts who have studied photos of six new North Korean missiles unveiled at a military parade in Pyongyang this month have concluded that they were low-quality fakes. German missile engineers Markus Schiller and Robert Schmucker of Schmucker Technologie said their findings cast doubt on the impoverished Communist state's claims of military strength. &quot;For now, the ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) presentation was nothing else than a nice dog and pony show,&quot; they wrote in an April 18 analysis posted online at Arms Control Wonk ...

     <title>Illinois to test investor appetite with $1.8 billion deal</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Illinois will see next week if yield-hungry investors will continue to snap up its bonds despite concerns about its huge unfunded pension liability and structural budget deficit. The state will sell about $1.8 billion of general obligation refunding bonds through Jefferies &amp; Co on Tuesday, adding to the $1.375 billion of debt it sold in the first quarter. Illinois' last sale of $500 million of GO bonds in March attracted orders for $2.3 billion, allowing the state to boost the size of the deal and cut yields. ...

     <title>Campaign treasurer for NYC comptroller indicted</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - The campaign treasurer for New York City Comptroller John Liu has been indicted for making a false statement to federal officials, according to a court filing, further weakening Liu's bid to become mayor in 2013. In February, Liu's campaign treasurer, Jia Hou, was arrested and charged with fraud for violating contribution limits. Prosecutors said she had used &quot;straw donors&quot; to funnel large, illegal contributions to Liu's mayoral campaign. Straw donors make a campaign contribution in their own names but with funds provided by someone else, or are reimbursed for the donation later. ...

     <title>Chesapeake Wyoming well leak under control</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Workers curbed a natural-gas leak from a stricken Chesapeake Energy Corp. well in Wyoming about three days after a blowout, the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commission said on Friday. Boots and Coots, a pressure control company owned by Houston-based Halliburton and contracted by Chesapeake after the well blowout on Tuesday, was pumping drilling mud into the well a day after its efforts were hampered by wind and adverse weather. The well stopped leaking natural gas about three days after Chesapeake lost control while installing a well casing, the Commission said. ...

      SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) - A 1,300-acre dump to bury low-level radioactive waste has opened in a remote corner of west Texas, the fourth U.S. site to allow such waste, despite concerns about water seepage at the site, which sits above the huge and vital Ogallala aquifer. In a letter to Waste Control Specialists LLC of Dallas, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality granted approval to the company's dump near Andrews, Texas, about 45 miles northwest of Midland and close to the New Mexico border. ...
