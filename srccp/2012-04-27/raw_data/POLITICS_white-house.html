     <title>Student loan rate extension passed under threat of veto</title>
     <description>
      The House on Friday passed a Republican version of a bill that would extend the low 3.4 percent rate on government-subsidized student loans, despite pressure from conservative groups to oppose the measure and a veto threat from the White House.The Republican bill, which passed by a close vote of 215-195, would extend the low interest rate on student loans for one year. Unless Republicans and Democrats can agree on a final bill, the rate for federally subsidized students loans will double this year. Democrats support extending the rate, but disagree with the way Republicans want to pay for it. ...
