Back on the mound for the first time since tossing just the 21st perfect game in the major leagues on Saturday, Humber (1-1) was far from perfect against Boston, giving up nine runs on eight hits over five shaky innings at U.S. Cellular Field. &quot;This game will humble you,&quot; Humber told reporters. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
