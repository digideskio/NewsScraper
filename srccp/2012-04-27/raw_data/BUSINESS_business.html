Expedia shares surged 26.7 percent to $41.33 and was the top percentage gainer on Nasdaq, followed by Amazon, which climbed 15.5 percent to $226.30. The gains follow a week of mostly robust earnings results, which have boosted the S&amp;P 500 earnings growth rate to 7.2 percent this week from 3.2 percent at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters data. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Exclusive: Chesapeake board member lent money to CEO McClendon</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - As Chesapeake Energy Corp.'s board of directors moves to distance itself from loans taken by CEO Aubrey McClendon, documents reviewed by Reuters show that at least one former board member had undisclosed personal financial ties to him in the past. Now-retired board member Frederick Whittemore lent money to McClendon in the late 1990s, the documents show, even as Whittemore helped determine how much the CEO should be paid to run Chesapeake. This week, the energy giant reversed an earlier statement that its board was &quot;fully aware&quot; of up to $1. ...

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment inched up to 76.4 from 76.2 in March. The survey topped economists' forecasts for 75.7, which had been the preliminary figure reported in early April. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.2 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Friday, moderating from the fourth quarter's 3 percent rate. Economists had expected somewhat firmer growth, but were taken by surprise by a big drop in defense spending. Still, growth was stronger than the 1.5 percent or less pace analysts had anticipated early in the quarter. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Unemployment shot up to 24 percent in the first quarter, one of the worst jobless figures in the developed world. Retail sales slumped for the twenty-first consecutive month as a recession cuts into consumer spending. &quot;The figures are terrible for everyone and terrible for the government ... ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Unemployment shot up to 24 percent in the first quarter, one of the worst jobless figures in the developed world. Retail sales slumped for the twenty-first consecutive month as a recession cuts into consumer spending. &quot;The figures are terrible for everyone and terrible for the government ... ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp will put its money into projects in other countries if environmental changes to its proposed $4.8 billion Conga gold mine in Peru prove economically unfeasible, the head of the U.S. company said on Friday. &quot;We have other options if it is not favorable,&quot; Chief Executive Officer Richard O'Brien told Wall Street analysts on a conference call.

     <description>
      MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's borrowing costs rose to 5.84 percent at a benchmark 10-year bond auction on Friday, their highest level since January, after a credit ratings cut for Spain overnight added to markets' concerns about the debt of weaker euro zone countries. The two-notch downgrade by rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's weighed on euro zone bond markets ahead of the Italian sale, further increasing the cost the Treasury had to shoulder to sell 5.95 billion euros in bonds. ...

     <title>Analysis: Companies plan for two-speed Europe</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Companies are planning for a two speed Europe, devising strategies to take advantage of growth in the northern part of the continent while plotting more corporate austerity for the moribund south. Dismal overall European sales were a recurring theme among big U.S. and European companies reporting first quarter results in the past fortnight. But beneath the headline numbers was a clear trend of a bifurcated economy - recovery in Germany and the Nordic countries combined with further sales drops in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal. ...

     <description>
      LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Almost a third of Credit Suisse shareholders rejected the bank's pay plan on Friday and UK rival Barclays was braced for a similar revolt as investors vented their fury at executive pay deals and called for a bigger slice of profits. Credit Suisse said 31.6 pct of investors who voted opposed the bank's remuneration plan, the latest in a series of rebukes for top banks over pay, but still allowing the non-binding vote to pass. ...

     <title>Glencore profits from metals backlog in Dutch port</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - London Metal Exchange rules on the amount of stock released each day are playing to the advantage of Glencore , which is moving thousands of tonnes of metal to warehouses in the Dutch port of Vlissingen, industry sources say. Exchange regulations allow warehouse companies to release only a fraction of their inventories each day, much less than is regularly taken in for storage. Clients wait in queues to collect the metal, all the while paying rent to the warehouses. ...
