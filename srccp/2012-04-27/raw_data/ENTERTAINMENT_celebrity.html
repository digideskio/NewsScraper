The former cast member of Bravo's &quot;Real Housewives of D.C.&quot; announced his intentions Wednesday to run for governor of Virginia in 2013. His camp says he has filed the necessary paperwork, but he still has time before making it official - the state's elections board can't accept declarations of candidacy until the same year the vote is held. Salahi, who plans to run as a Republican, stressed politics over publicity as his reason for taking action. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

More than a dozen insiders in the ruling African National Congress told Reuters that Zuma had the race in hand even though there are strong factions in the party who want him out and could make things difficult. &quot;It's Zuma's race to lose,&quot; said one senior ANC member. The winner of December's party vote is almost certain to be its nominee in the 2014 presidential election. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Whenever she smiled, cameras clicked and crowds roared with approval. She was just 14 at the time and apparently living the ultimate American dream. Or so it seemed. The medals, the cheesy grin, even the bear, were all just a mask for the demons she was battling. Privately, her life was starting to unravel. Her parents had just divorced and she did not know how to cope. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
