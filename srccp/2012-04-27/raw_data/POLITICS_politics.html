     <description>
      DAKAR (Reuters) - Mali's junta said on Friday it would resist any deployment of West African soldiers in the country and treat foreign forces sent there under a regional plan as &quot;the enemy&quot;. The comments came a day after regional bloc ECOWAS said it would send troops to Mali and Guinea-Bissau to tackle the aftermath of coups that, in the case of Mali, has left more than half the country in rebel hands. &quot;We will not accept any ECOWAS soldiers on our territory. This is non-negotiable. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global oil inventories grew over the last two months despite the loss of further supplies from Iran, according to a U.S. report that gave leeway for the Obama administration to press ahead with sanctions on the OPEC nation. The Energy Information Administration report, required every 60 days by the Iran sanctions law President Barack Obama signed in December, gave a mostly positive assessment of global oil supplies, which typically build at this time of year. ...

They said dozens of youths threw stones at police who used teargas and stun grenades to block the planned march to the Pearl roundabout, the centre of an uprising last year which the government suppressed with the help of troops from neighbors, including Saudi Arabia.

     <title>Czech centre-right government survives confidence vote</title>
     <description>
      PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech centre-right cabinet won a parliamentary vote of confidence on Friday, gaining a new lease on life after the break-up of a junior ruling party brought the austerity-driven administration to the brink of collapse. The result was expected after a faction from the split coalition partner declared allegiance to the cabinet, but Prime Minister Petr Necas still faces a tough task to push ahead with his fiscal and health reforms in an evenly split parliament. Analysts say an early election before regular polls in 2014 is still possible. ...

     <title>Campaign treasurer for NYC comptroller indicted</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - The campaign treasurer for New York City Comptroller John Liu has been indicted for making a false statement to federal officials, according to a court filing, further weakening Liu's bid to become mayor in 2013. In February, Liu's campaign treasurer, Jia Hou, was arrested and charged with fraud for violating contribution limits. Prosecutors said she had used &quot;straw donors&quot; to funnel large, illegal contributions to Liu's mayoral campaign. Straw donors make a campaign contribution in their own names but with funds provided by someone else, or are reimbursed for the donation later. ...

     <description>
      LOS TEQUES, Venezuela (Reuters) - President Hugo Chavez's big poll lead puts him in a strong position ahead of Venezuela's presidential election, but it could also convince radical opponents violence is the only way to beat him, a senior campaign strategist said. Despite ongoing cancer treatment, Chavez is favored to extend his 13-year rule at the October 7 vote, with most opinion polls giving him an advantage of at least 10 percentage points over opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. ...
