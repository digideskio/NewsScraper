Soft-tissue sarcoma is a rare but aggressive form of cancer that afflicted about 11,000 Americans last year, 4,000 of whom died from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute. The cancer begins in the muscles, fat or other tissues. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Despite recommendations not to screen men age 75 and older for prostate cancer, most elderly men still get tested, according to a new survey. &quot;I think there is a lot of push from patients to get (the test),&quot; said Dr. Edward Messing from the University of Rochester Medical Center, who worked on the study. &quot;Eighty-year-olds don't think they're that old anymore, and maybe they're not. They think they still have a life ahead of them.&quot; In 2008, the U.S. ...

      HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong on Thursday suspended imports of poultry products, including eggs and frozen meat, from China's northeastern Liaoning province for 21 days after the authorities there confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu. Hong Kong imported about 28,000 tonnes of frozen poultry and 103 million poultry eggs from Liaoning in 2011. &quot;The outbreak in Dalian city was among chickens,&quot; said a Hong Kong government spokesman, who had no further details. The H5N1 virus mainly affects birds, but occasionally jumps to people. ...

      (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said U.S. regulators had extended their review of its diabetes drug alogliptin, requesting additional data on what the company hopes will be the successor to its top-selling Actos drug. Shares of Takeda fell as much as 2 percent after Japan's biggest drugmaker announced during Tokyo trading on Thursday that it had received the request from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Actos lost patent protection in 2011, and generic versions are expected to hit the market later this year. ...

     <title>What is Mad Cow Disease?</title>
     <description>
      Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE, attacks a cow's nervous system and causes the animal's brain to swell - like a sponge. This slow-growing disease is fatal for cattle but it indirectly affects a small percentage of humans that consume them. People do not &quot;catch&quot; mad cow disease; instead the disease evolves into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Many doctors don't expect new guidelines to affect how often they screen men for prostate cancer, results of a new survey suggest. Last fall, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a draft of new prostate cancer screening guidelines, which recommend against routine prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing in average-risk men. ...

     <description>
      This week, TV personality Giuliana Rancic announced she is having a baby, via gestational surrogate. After years of trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization, a diagnosis of breast cancer almost removed all hopes of having a biological child. This raises the question -- is pregnancy safe after a breast cancer diagnosis? Susan G. Komen for the Cure posted the results of a study authored by H. Azim Jr and L. Emeye, titled &quot;Pregnancy following estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is safe -- results from a large multi-center case-control study. ...

      COMMENTARY | Every time information emerges about the global impact of our modern meat industry, the most dedicated of meat eaters are quick to jump up in defense of their habits. We tend to turn a blind eye to news about diseases, ecological problems, and pollutants being incubated in the dense factory &quot;farms&quot; that speckle our land. Unless a disease is likely to spread to human beings through direct ingestion of the meat, we tend to completely ignore the risk. ...
