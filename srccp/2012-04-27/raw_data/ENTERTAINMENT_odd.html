     <title>Man jailed for smuggling iguana meat into United States</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - A Las Vegas man who tried to sneak 115 oven-ready iguanas into the United States from Mexico has been sentenced to two years in prison for illegally importing the reptiles, authorities said on Thursday. A federal judge ordered Eliodoro Soria Fonseca, 38, to serve 24 months in prison, the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of California said. Fonseca was arrested as he tried to cross into California through the Otay Mesa port of entry, south of San Diego, last June with the iguana meat packed in coolers. ...

     <title>Kyrgyzstan gas company extinguishes ‘Eternal Flame’ due to unpaid bill</title>
     <description>
      It is unwise to test the patience of Bishkek's gas-supply services. A power company in Kyrgyzstan recently extinguished the former Soviet nation's &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; because of an unpaid gas bill. That might sound downright unpatriotic, but in fairness to the gas company, it was a pretty big bill; the government owed around $9,400. The debt, [...]

     <title>HIV-positive man fights charge that saliva was deadly</title>
     <description>
      ALBANY, New York (Reuters) - A gay-rights group is urging New York state's high court to overturn the conviction of an HIV-positive man whose saliva was found to be a &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; in a biting case. David Plunkett was sentenced in 2007 to 10 years in prison for aggravated assault, a felony that requires the use of a &quot;dangerous instrument.&quot; Plunkett argued unsuccessfully the charge could not be sustained because HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva. The Court of Appeals, New York's top court, will hear Plunkett's case on Thursday. ...
