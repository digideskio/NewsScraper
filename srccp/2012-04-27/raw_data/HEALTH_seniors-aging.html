     <title>Why Save for Retirement?</title>
     <description>
      Retirement saving is hard. Why should I save when I can spend my money now? I can use the money to buy new clothes, tickets to shows, eat out, and many other fun things. There are many practical and emotional reasons why we should opt for delayed gratification and squirrel a portion of our paycheck away in 401(k) and other retirement accounts.

     <title>The Case for Fixing Social Security Right Now</title>
     <description>
      Every time I write about the financial condition of Social Security, I get incredibly angry at Congress and the White House. They should step up to the plate and apply the relatively minor financial changes that would restore the program to complete financial sustainability. Next to the truly tough issues of healthcare spending, federal deficits, and taxes, Social Security is a walk in the park.

     <title>How to Communicate with Younger Colleagues</title>
     <description>
      In today's workforce, baby boomers constantly interact with younger co-workers and managers. These younger workers have been raised in a generation of social media, with connectivity always and everywhere. Individuals constantly update their status and current events via Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, texting, and other technologies. If anything new or unexpected occurs, friends are notified immediately. This tendency to constantly update and make on-the-fly changes sometimes leads to reluctance to meet commitments for meetings and appointments.

     <title>Social Security Won't Be There, so Why Not Be Rich?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | How many times has a politician used the fear of losing Social Security as a ploy to persuade voters? More times than I can count. The concept of a safety net for those who lack financial planning skills has been an effective vote-grabber since 1935. And while all wage-earning Americans are required to pay into the program, people my age and younger will likely never see a return.

Here are the results of Social Security's annual financial checkup:

     <title>Medicare trustee report hangs on uncertain assumptions</title>
     <description>

The annual report of the Medicare trustees predicted that the program's key hospital trust fund will become exhausted in 2024, prompting Medicare to begin paying out only 87 percent of scheduled hospital benefits to tens of millions of future retirees and disabled beneficiaries. ...

A report by the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress, recommends canceling the Medicare Advantage quality bonus payment initiative. The three-year project is seen as the largest-scale test of an effort to improve Medicare services to date. The watchdog agency said the U.S. ...
