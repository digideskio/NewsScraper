     <title>HIV-positive man fights charge that saliva was deadly</title>
     <description>
      ALBANY, New York (Reuters) - A gay-rights group is urging New York state's high court to overturn the conviction of an HIV-positive man whose saliva was found to be a &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; in a biting case. David Plunkett was sentenced in 2007 to 10 years in prison for aggravated assault, a felony that requires the use of a &quot;dangerous instrument.&quot; Plunkett argued unsuccessfully the charge could not be sustained because HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva. The Court of Appeals, New York's top court, will hear Plunkett's case on Thursday. ...

      AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Lawyers for Planned Parenthood told a federal judge on Thursday that the healthcare of 40,000 women would be disrupted as soon as May 1 unless he blocks a new Texas rule that excludes the family planning organization's clinics from a state program. But lawyers for the state said Planned Parenthood's mission was contrary to a Texas Women's Health Program goal of reducing abortions. The program provides cancer screenings, birth control and other health services to more than 100,000 low-income women. U.S. ...

Bayer had said in February that 170 Yasmin/Yaz cases in the U.S. had been settled out of court.

The lawsuit filed by a group of Planned Parenthood clinics that do not provide abortions says the rule is unconstitutional and that it will lead to tens of thousands of women being unable to get preventive healthcare from their chosen provider. ...

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators are adding information to the labels on a popular class of birth control pills that includes Bayer AG's Yaz and Yasmin, to show they may raise the risk of blood clots. All common birth control pills increase a woman's chances of getting potentially fatal blood clots. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that some studies showed the danger may be even higher for more recent pills that contain the compound drospirenone, a synthetic hormone. ...

     <description>
      ATLANTA (Reuters) - Public schools in the United States are making &quot;little progress&quot; in expanding instruction in how to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV, a new federal study concluded. Between 2008 and 2010, the percentage of public schools teaching key topics on prevention did not increase in the 45 states surveyed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In middle schools, 11 states saw declines during the two-year period and no state saw an increase, the CDC said. The level of instruction was stable in high schools. ...

     <title>Genital warts tied to range of cancers</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People who've ever had genital warts may have a somewhat higher risk of several types of cancer -- possibly including common skin cancers, a new study suggests. The findings, reported in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, confirm some well-established connections between the genital warts virus and certain cancers. And they hint that there could be additional risks. Genital warts are caused by certain strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It's well known that some of those HPV strains -- some of which are the focus of vaccines -- can also promote tumors. ...

     <title>GSK's new once-daily HIV drug matches Merck rival</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - A new once-daily AIDS drug from GlaxoSmithKline and its partner Shionogi proved just as good as Merck &amp; Co's twice-daily rival Isentress in a late-stage clinical trial, boosting hopes for the product. Both GSK's new drug dolutegravir and Isentress are so-called integrase inhibitors, a novel class of drugs for fighting HIV/AIDS that block the virus causing the disease from entering cells. Dolutegravir is important for GSK since it could help rejuvenate its HIV/AIDS business - an area of medicine it used to dominate but where it has fallen behind rivals in recent years. ...
