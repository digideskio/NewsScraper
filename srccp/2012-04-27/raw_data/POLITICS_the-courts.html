     <title>U.S. finds discrimination in Memphis juvenile courts</title>
     <description>
      NASHVILLE, Tenn (Reuters) - Black youths arrested in Memphis, Tennessee, were much more likely than white juveniles to be jailed and tried as adults, discriminatory practices that also affect Hispanic youths in other cities, the Justice Department said on Thursday. A review of 66,000 juvenile court cases in Memphis, where numerous abuses drew Justice Department investigators in 2009, revealed &quot;serious and systemic failures&quot; in the way youthful offenders were treated, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said. ...

     <title>Determining Immigration Status Will Be Difficult for Arizona</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to Reuters, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor -- the only Hispanic justice on the court -- was very active in Wednesday's oral arguments regarding the case of whether Arizona can enforce its illegal immigration law. And she made a very good point: It will be difficult to determine whether someone is an illegal immigrant or not. The difficulty is caused by lapses in the federal system. And it could cause people to end up waiting in jail for the government to determine their status.

     <title>What Will Happen If the Supreme Court Backs Arizona on Immigration?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Illegal immigration is a complicated issue that doesn't seem to have a perfect solution, but the controversial Arizona immigration law is not the right answer. According to the Associated Press, the Supreme Court may &quot;follow through on its suggestion that it would let local police enforce the most controversial part&quot; of the law.

Now comes the nationwide angst of waiting - as long as two months - for decisions, particularly the one that will resolve the most high-stakes and closely watched case of the year: the challenge to the Obama-sponsored healthcare law. The collective impatience is fueling a mini-industry of rumors, wagers and speculation not seen since the Bush v. Gore case of 2000, when a presidential election hung in the balance. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Arizona Has Solid Argument in Supreme Court Immigration Case</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to Reuters, Arizona argued before the Supreme Court that its controversial use of state and local law enforcement to police suspected illegal immigration through citizenship checks during routine traffic stops is Constitutional. Several of the points of contention brought up by Arizona and the federal government are valid. Given the arguments, immigration could become the next potent states' rights issue.

     <title>Arizona's immigration law: A Supreme Court disaster for Obama?</title>
     <description>
      For the second time in as many months, President Obama is clashing with the highest court in the land. In March, skeptical conservatives on the Supreme Court appeared to doubt the constitutionality of Obama's 2010 health care overhaul. And this week, the court seemed ready to uphold the most controversial provision of S.B. 1070, a tough immigration law that Arizona passed in 2010. The provision in question requires police officers to determine the immigration status of any person they &quot;reasonably&quot; suspect is an illegal immigrant, which critics (including the president's Justice Department) ...
