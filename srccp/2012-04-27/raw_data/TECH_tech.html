      What do&nbsp;Silicon Valley startups have in common with fraternities? A lot, it turns out, based on recent reports about the rise of the &quot;brogrammer&quot;— a would-be tech superstar whose approach to business and life owes as much to&nbsp;Animal House&nbsp;as it does&nbsp;Revenge of the Nerds. How exactly do two seemingly different worlds (dingy frat houses and tech incubators) &nbsp;breed the same type of human? Well,&nbsp;creating bros only takes a certain environment that both Silicon Valley and college fraternity houses share. ...

     <title>Getting 'Draw Something' on the Kindle Fire is a Great Move</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Anyone who has an iPod, iPhone, iPad or Android-powered device has likely downloaded and played the app &quot;Draw Something&quot; by now since Mashable is reporting the game passed the 50 million download mark in 50 days. All the mania that surrounded the popular guess-what-I-drew extravaganza is only going to be amplified over the course of the next week or two. The main reason is that a lot more people are going to have access to it.

     <title>Netflix is in Serious Trouble</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The recent stock price troubles of Internet video streaming giant Netflix are a prime example of the troubles facing the subscriber-based service. As WebProNews reports, Netflix shares have plummeted despite the company adding 3 million subscribers during the first quarter. Growth is slowing, which is worrisome, but doubts about Netflix's business model are also starting to creep up. The short story would be that Netflix is on its way out of the limelight.

     <title>Are You a Klouchebag?</title>
     <description>
      Klouchebag.com, a new parody of Klout,&nbsp;is the most entertaining expression we've seen of a growing backlash against the clout-measuring service's recent spate of media attention. Klout is a service that measures your influence across various social networks based on an algorithm that looks at who retweets or likes your posts. This determines whether they, and by proxy, you, are &quot;influential&quot; and Klout then assigns you a score. Nicholas Thompson writes in The New Yorker today that he's already seen a &quot;Klout score&quot; cited in a job application. ...
