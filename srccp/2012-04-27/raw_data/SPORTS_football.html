The Stanford signal-caller was chosen with the No. 1 overall pick by the Colts in the NFL Draft on Thursday and inherits the starting spot now that Manning has left town. &quot;Peyton Manning, arguably the greatest ever,&quot; Luck told reporters at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan, site of the draft. &quot;He was my football hero growing up. &quot;I realize you don't really replace a guy like that. Those shoes to fill are huge. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
