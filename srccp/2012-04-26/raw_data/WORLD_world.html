Syria blamed &quot;terrorist&quot; bomb-makers for Wednesday's blast. Information Minister Adnan Mahmoud also accused rebel militiamen of repeated violations of the ceasefire and said Damascus was &quot;reserving the right to respond to any violation or attack&quot;, state news agency SANA reported. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
