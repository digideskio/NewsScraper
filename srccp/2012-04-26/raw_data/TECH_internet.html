     <title>White House warns that Obama would veto cyber security bill</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama would veto a cyber security bill being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives if it was presented to him for signature, the White House said on Wednesday, citing privacy and oversight concerns. The bill, which the House is expected to start debating on Thursday and to vote upon on Friday, would allow the government and corporations to share information about hacking attacks. ...

     <title>Close call in &quot;Idol&quot; and &quot;Voice&quot; social media race</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - &quot;The Voice&quot; has proven to be a formidable foe to the formerly untouchable &quot;American Idol&quot; on the ratings front. But how do the two shows compare when it comes to social media? Advertising Age recently teamed with social-media monitoring firm Trendrr in an effort to determine which show is creating the most buzz in the social-media world. And while the results aren't entirely conclusive (and quite possibly not entirely scientific), it appears that NBC's &quot;The Voice&quot; is coming out ahead. ...

The information comes from Google’s testimony in an ongoing trial with Oracle. Android Senior Vice President Andy Rubin made the prediction based on tablet market data from Morgan Stanley, which estimated a total of 46 million tablets would be sold by 2012. The Mountain View-based company’s expectations have fallen short, however, and Apple has dominated the tablet market with&nbsp;more than 67 million iPads sold thus far. The Internet giant also expected Android tablets to generate up to $110 million&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>The Very Best Ways to Explain How Much Cash Apple Has</title>
     <description>
      The Internet, in an attempt to both say something different about the talked-to-death&nbsp;Apple earnings report&nbsp;and the $110 billion of cash it has on hand&nbsp;and also give readers a visual&nbsp;representation&nbsp;of the massively abstract, resorted many, many comparisons. It's time to judge their efforts. Numbers can only get a reader so far. If we had $110 billion in our checking accounts, that would indeed be an absurd amount of money. But, Apple's not a single human, it's a huge company. ...

     <title>Facebook Should Pay Attention to Netflix</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Facebook should probably take a hard look at the fate of Netflix stock. Granted the Internet giants have little in common on the surface, but as CNBC reports, the chief issue with Netflix's recent stock price drop has to do with expansion concerns. When it comes to expansion, Facebook is also facing similar questions leading up to what is likely to be a record setting IPO. Facebook has set a torrid pace for growth, but seems unable to keep up that pace.

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Online travel agency Expedia Inc posted a higher quarterly profit on an adjusted basis as revenue rose, and its shares gained more than 15 percent. &quot;Overall it looks pretty strong,&quot; Morningstar analyst Dan Su said, noting a rise in domestic and international bookings. &quot;You probably would expect some headwinds in the Western economies would be pressuring growth&quot; but there was no sign of that in the Expedia report, she said.

COMMENTARY: RONALD JOSEY, ANALYST, THINKEQUITY &quot;What jumped out to me was the gross profit, growth as well as their overall operating income margins of 3 percent relative to where expectations were.

Net, net is: a much better topline than we were expecting and a much, much better bottomline. &quot;The company is certainly performing incredibly well. ...

Android Senior Vice President Andy Rubin made the prediction based on tablet market data from Morgan Stanley, which estimated a total of 46 million tablets would be sold by 2012. The Mountain View-based company’s expectations have fallen short, however, and Apple has dominated the tablet market with&nbsp;more than 67 million iPads sold thus far. The Internet giant also expected Android tablets to generate up to $110 million&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>The Very Best Ways to Explain How Much Cash Apple Has</title>
     <description>
      The Internet, in an attempt to both say something different about the talked-to-death&nbsp;Apple earnings report&nbsp;and the $110 billion of cash it has on hand&nbsp;and also give readers a visual&nbsp;representation&nbsp;of the massively abstract, resorted many, many comparisons. It's time to judge their efforts. Numbers can only get a reader so far. If we had $110 billion in our checking accounts, that would indeed be an absurd amount of money. But, Apple's not a single human, it's a huge company. ...

The original designs surfaced during Google’s trial against Oracle over the use of Java in Android, The Verge reported. Additional documents revealed that Google was looking to change T-Mobile’s plan pricing structure, and offer unlimited data for $9.99 a month. To subsidize the reduced cost, the Internet giant would have agreed to not take the commission it might earn from the carrier when it referred Android buyers to its online store. Google’s original plan never became a reality,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
