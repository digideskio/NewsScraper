      (Reuters) - Pennsylvania's longest-severing U.S. congressman, Tim Holden, was defeated in a Democratic primary election. Matthew Cartwright, a lawyer who criticized Holden for his opposition to President Barack Obama's healthcare law, defeated the 10-term Democrat in Tuesday's election, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State's preliminary findings.

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led House of Representatives, in an election-year showdown with President Barack Obama, will vote on Friday to extend for 12-months a low interest rate for federal student loans, the top Republican said on Wednesday. House Speaker John Boehner made the surprise announcement, adding that the $6 billion extension would be funded with money from what he described as a &quot;slush fund&quot; in Obama's healthcare overhaul law. Boehner's declaration came after Obama, at campaign-style events, hammered Congress to extend the loan rate before it doubles on July 1 to 6. ...

     <title>House Republicans Offer Student Loan Rate Fix</title>
     <description>
      House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday offered legislation to put off for one year a student loan interest rate hike, keeping subsidized student loans at 3.4 percent. The proposal responds to calls from Democrats and President Obama to stop the current student loan interest rates from doubling if Congress doesn’t act by June 30. U.S. PIRG estimates that would add $2,800 to the average subsidized Stafford loan over 10 years.

     <description>
      A Republican bill that would keep interest rates on federal student loans low isn’t sincere, the White House said on Thursday, because it wasn't part of the House Republican budget. House Speaker John Boehner charged back, blasting President Obama and congressional Democrats for conjuring up a “fake fight” in an election year.
