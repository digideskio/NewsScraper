Exxon's oil and natural gas production slumped 5 percent in the first quarter, leading to a lower net profit and pushing its shares down 1.7 percent -- an especially big move for a $400 billion company that just increased its dividend the previous day by a better-than-expected 21 percent. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Refining losses hit China's PetroChina, Sinopec</title>
     <description>
      HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hefty refining losses continued to weigh on profits at Chinese state oil giants PetroChina and Sinopec Corp in the first three months of the year, with the latter posting a worse than expected 35 percent drop in earnings. But the worst may be over because the Chinese government raised gasoline and diesel prices twice in the first quarter, and crude prices may have peaked for this year, some analysts say. &quot;This should mark the bottom of their earnings cycle,&quot; said Gordon Kwan, head of Energy Research at Mirae Asset Securities. ...

     <title>Expedia tops profit estimates, shares up</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Online travel agency Expedia Inc posted a higher quarterly profit on an adjusted basis as revenue rose, and its shares gained more than 15 percent. &quot;Overall it looks pretty strong,&quot; Morningstar analyst Dan Su said, noting a rise in domestic and international bookings. &quot;You probably would expect some headwinds in the Western economies would be pressuring growth&quot; but there was no sign of that in the Expedia report, she said. The company had a net loss of $3.3 million, or 2 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with earnings of $52 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. ...

COMMENTARY: RONALD JOSEY, ANALYST, THINKEQUITY &quot;What jumped out to me was the gross profit, growth as well as their overall operating income margins of 3 percent relative to where expectations were. Net, net is: a much better topline than we were expecting and a much, much better bottomline. &quot;The company is certainly performing incredibly well. ...
