The information comes from Google’s testimony in an ongoing trial with Oracle. Android Senior Vice President Andy Rubin made the prediction based on tablet market data from Morgan Stanley, which estimated a total of 46 million tablets would be sold by 2012. The Mountain View-based company’s expectations have fallen short, however, and Apple has dominated the tablet market with&nbsp;more than 67 million iPads sold thus far. The Internet giant also expected Android tablets to generate up to $110 million&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Not Just Dropbox: Google Drive's Lesser-Known Competitors</title>
     <description>
      Google finally launched its Google Drive cloud storage service Tuesday, which gives you up to 5 GB of space online for free. Windows PC and Mac users can download an app for it that works much like the Dropbox app, while a mobile app lets you get to your files from an Android smartphone or tablet. It also integrates with Google's Chrome Web browser, to let you open your files or create new ones using web apps that you have installed.

The information comes from Google’s testimony in an ongoing trial with Oracle. Android Senior Vice President Andy Rubin made the prediction based on tablet market data from Morgan Stanley, which estimated a total of 46 million tablets would be sold by 2012. The Mountain View-based company’s expectations have fallen short, however, and Apple has dominated the tablet market with&nbsp;more than 67 million iPads sold thus far.

     <title>Not Just Dropbox: Google Drive's Lesser-Known Competitors</title>
     <description>
      Google finally launched its Google Drive cloud storage service Tuesday, which gives you up to 5 GB of space online for free. Windows PC and Mac users can download an app for it that works much like the Dropbox app, while a mobile app lets you get to your files from an Android smartphone or tablet. It also integrates with Google's Chrome Web browser, to let you open your files or create new ones using web apps that you have installed.

      HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's Nokia and Taiwan's HTC won a key European ruling that a patent of German firm IPCom, which was threatening sales of their phones in Germany, was invalid in its current form.

Citing unnamed sources, The Verge reports that the new streaming service will work across several platforms including Xbox, Windows 8, Windows Phone, iOS and Android, accessible through a native app or a web browser. Code-named “Woodstock,” the service is reportedly comparable to Spotify, potentially allowing users to stream unlimited music. The service will also seemingly feature deep Facebook integration and a “scan and match” cloud locker feature similar to iTunes Match. According to The Verge, the service will be part of a larger effort to shift away from Microsoft’s Zune brand. Read&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
