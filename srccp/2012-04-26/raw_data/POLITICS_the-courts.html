     <title>It's Not Easy Being Donald Verrilli</title>
     <description>
      For the second time in two months, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli is being blamed for blowing a case in front of the Supreme Court. Though the justices have yet to rule on anything, the country's major newspapers and TV networks have concluded that the court is aiming to uphold Arizona's tough immigration bill. That decision would be a major loss for the left and the blogosphere knows&nbsp;precisely&nbsp;who to blame: Donald Verrilli.&nbsp;

     <title>Federal Government Doesn't Want to Know About Illegal Immigration</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to The Lookout, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts stated on Wednesday that it seems to him that the federal government just doesn't want to know who's here illegally or not. Indeed, it would seem that way, reading some of the oral arguments made this week to the Supreme Court in the case against Arizona's controversial illegal immigration law.

     <title>What Will Happen If the Supreme Court Backs Arizona on Immigration?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Illegal immigration is a complicated issue that doesn't seem to have a perfect solution, but the controversial Arizona immigration law is not the right answer. According to the Associated Press, the Supreme Court may &quot;follow through on its suggestion that it would let local police enforce the most controversial part&quot; of the law.

     <title>As Supreme Court mulls healthcare, rumors fly</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - This week the U.S. Supreme Court wrapped up the last oral arguments of its current term. Now comes the nationwide angst of waiting - as long as two months - for decisions, particularly the one that will resolve the most high-stakes and closely watched case of the year: the challenge to the Obama-sponsored healthcare law. The collective impatience is fueling a mini-industry of rumors, wagers and speculation not seen since the Bush v. Gore case of 2000, when a presidential election hung in the balance. ...

     <title>Arizona Has Solid Argument in Supreme Court Immigration Case</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to Reuters, Arizona argued before the Supreme Court that its controversial use of state and local law enforcement to police suspected illegal immigration through citizenship checks during routine traffic stops is Constitutional. Several of the points of contention brought up by Arizona and the federal government are valid. Given the arguments, immigration could become the next potent states' rights issue.
