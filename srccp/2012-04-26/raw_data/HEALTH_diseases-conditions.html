     <title>Hong Kong suspends poultry imports from Liaoning over bird flu</title>
     <description>
      HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong on Thursday suspended imports of poultry products, including eggs and frozen meat, from China's northeastern Liaoning province for 21 days after the authorities there confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu. Hong Kong imported about 28,000 tonnes of frozen poultry and 103 million poultry eggs from Liaoning in 2011. &quot;The outbreak in Dalian city was among chickens,&quot; said a Hong Kong government spokesman, who had no further details. The H5N1 virus mainly affects birds, but occasionally jumps to people. ...

     <description>

     <title>U.S. delays decision on Takeda diabetes drug</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said U.S. regulators had extended their review of its diabetes drug alogliptin, requesting additional data on what the company hopes will be the successor to its top-selling Actos drug. Shares of Takeda fell as much as 2 percent after Japan's biggest drugmaker announced during Tokyo trading on Thursday that it had received the request from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Actos lost patent protection in 2011, and generic versions are expected to hit the market later this year. ...

     <title>What is Mad Cow Disease?</title>
     <description>
      Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE, attacks a cow's nervous system and causes the animal's brain to swell - like a sponge. This slow-growing disease is fatal for cattle but it indirectly affects a small percentage of humans that consume them. People do not &quot;catch&quot; mad cow disease; instead the disease evolves into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

     <title>Doctors not all on board with new prostate cancer recommendations</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Many doctors don't expect new guidelines to affect how often they screen men for prostate cancer, results of a new survey suggest. Last fall, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a draft of new prostate cancer screening guidelines, which recommend against routine prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing in average-risk men. ...

     <title>Pregnancy Is Safe After Breast Cancer</title>
     <description>
      This week, TV personality Giuliana Rancic announced she is having a baby, via gestational surrogate. After years of trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization, a diagnosis of breast cancer almost removed all hopes of having a biological child. This raises the question -- is pregnancy safe after a breast cancer diagnosis? Susan G. Komen for the Cure posted the results of a study authored by H. Azim Jr and L. Emeye, titled &quot;Pregnancy following estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is safe -- results from a large multi-center case-control study. ...

     <title>Boycott Beef to End Spread of Mad Cow Disease</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Every time information emerges about the global impact of our modern meat industry, the most dedicated of meat eaters are quick to jump up in defense of their habits. We tend to turn a blind eye to news about diseases, ecological problems, and pollutants being incubated in the dense factory &quot;farms&quot; that speckle our land. Unless a disease is likely to spread to human beings through direct ingestion of the meat, we tend to completely ignore the risk. ...

     <title>U.N. Must Consider Environmental Impact of Malaria Control</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | World-renowned conservationist John Muir once observed, &quot;When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.&quot; No matter how much we try to isolate our battles with our Mother Earth, we find that they are altogether connected -- and that winning one battle against the natural world can at times create new battles. The United Nations is currently seeking some $3.2 billion as part of its campaign to eradicate malaria, but this plan will do nothing positive if it does not focus on the health of our planet.

      (Reuters) - The U.S. Agriculture Department confirmed on Tuesday that it found a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, the nation's fourth, in a dairy cow in California. The USDA has begun to notify the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as well as its trading partners, but the finding should not affect U.S. beef exports, said John Clifford, the USDA's chief veterinary officer.

     <title>Factbox: Mad Cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Mad cow disease, scientifically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a fatal neurological disease in cattle caused by an abnormal form of a prion protein that destroys the brain and spinal cord. The disease was first identified in Great Britain in 1986, although research suggests that the first infections may have spontaneously occurred in the 1970s. The disease is believed to be spread by feeding calves meat and bone meal contaminated with BSE or scrapie, a prion disease in sheep. Illnesses similar to BSE also have been seen in elk, deer and exotic zoo animals. ...

     <title>Mad cow disease found in California; no human threat seen</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities reported the first U.S. case of mad cow disease in six years on Tuesday and quickly assured consumers and global importers that meat from the California dairy cow did not enter the food chain. John Clifford, the USDA's chief veterinary officer, said the case was &quot;atypical&quot; and that there was &quot;no cause for alarm&quot; from the animal. Cows can contract the disease spontaneously in rare cases and that it cannot be transmitted unless the brain or spinal tissue is consumed by humans or another animal, according to scientists. ...

     <title>Learning about snake venom for breast cancer</title>
     <description>
      We have been taught our entire lives to avoid venomous snakes, but new research may actually show that snake venom could be beneficial. Of course, we still need to avoid venomous snakes in the wild, but if you have breast cancer, the venom from certain snakes may be helpful to you. This research started when researcher Bill Haast discovered that cobra venom could be used to treat polio. This venom is used today to treat this devastating disease. Now Haast is harvesting copperhead venom and studying its potential for treating breast cancer.

     <title>Many older men still get prostate cancer testing</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Despite recommendations not to screen men age 75 and older for prostate cancer, most elderly men still get tested, according to a new survey. &quot;I think there is a lot of push from patients to get (the test),&quot; said Dr. Edward Messing from the University of Rochester Medical Center, who worked on the study. &quot;Eighty-year-olds don't think they're that old anymore, and maybe they're not. They think they still have a life ahead of them.&quot; In 2008, the U.S. ...

     <title>Fruit, veggies tied to lower diabetes risk</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People who get a range of fruits and vegetables in their diets may have a somewhat decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, a new study suggests. The findings, reported in the journal Diabetes Care, do not prove that eating your fruits and veggies will ward off type 2 diabetes -- a disease closely associated with obesity and old age. But researchers say the findings should give people yet more incentive to eat the way our mothers always told us. ...

      HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong on Thursday suspended imports of poultry products, including eggs and frozen meat, from China's northeastern Liaoning province for 21 days after the authorities there confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu. Hong Kong imported about 28,000 tonnes of frozen poultry and 103 million poultry eggs from Liaoning in 2011. &quot;The outbreak in Dalian city was among chickens,&quot; said a Hong Kong government spokesman, who had no further details. The H5N1 virus mainly affects birds, but occasionally jumps to people. ...

     <title>U.S. delays decision on Takeda diabetes drug</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said U.S. regulators had extended their review of its diabetes drug alogliptin, requesting additional data on what the company hopes will be the successor to its top-selling Actos drug. Shares of Takeda fell as much as 2 percent after Japan's biggest drugmaker announced during Tokyo trading on Thursday that it had received the request from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Actos lost patent protection in 2011, and generic versions are expected to hit the market later this year. ...

     <title>What is Mad Cow Disease?</title>
     <description>
      Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE, attacks a cow's nervous system and causes the animal's brain to swell - like a sponge. This slow-growing disease is fatal for cattle but it indirectly affects a small percentage of humans that consume them. People do not &quot;catch&quot; mad cow disease; instead the disease evolves into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

     <title>Doctors not all on board with new prostate cancer recommendations</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Many doctors don't expect new guidelines to affect how often they screen men for prostate cancer, results of a new survey suggest. Last fall, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a draft of new prostate cancer screening guidelines, which recommend against routine prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing in average-risk men. ...

     <title>Pregnancy Is Safe After Breast Cancer</title>
     <description>
      This week, TV personality Giuliana Rancic announced she is having a baby, via gestational surrogate. After years of trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization, a diagnosis of breast cancer almost removed all hopes of having a biological child. This raises the question -- is pregnancy safe after a breast cancer diagnosis? Susan G. Komen for the Cure posted the results of a study authored by H. Azim Jr and L. Emeye, titled &quot;Pregnancy following estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is safe -- results from a large multi-center case-control study. ...

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Every time information emerges about the global impact of our modern meat industry, the most dedicated of meat eaters are quick to jump up in defense of their habits. We tend to turn a blind eye to news about diseases, ecological problems, and pollutants being incubated in the dense factory &quot;farms&quot; that speckle our land. Unless a disease is likely to spread to human beings through direct ingestion of the meat, we tend to completely ignore the risk. ...

     <title>U.N. Must Consider Environmental Impact of Malaria Control</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | World-renowned conservationist John Muir once observed, &quot;When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.&quot; No matter how much we try to isolate our battles with our Mother Earth, we find that they are altogether connected -- and that winning one battle against the natural world can at times create new battles. The United Nations is currently seeking some $3.2 billion as part of its campaign to eradicate malaria, but this plan will do nothing positive if it does not focus on the health of our planet.

     <title>Factbox: Mad Cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Mad cow disease, scientifically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a fatal neurological disease in cattle caused by an abnormal form of a prion protein that destroys the brain and spinal cord. The disease was first identified in Great Britain in 1986, although research suggests that the first infections may have spontaneously occurred in the 1970s. The disease is believed to be spread by feeding calves meat and bone meal contaminated with BSE or scrapie, a prion disease in sheep. Illnesses similar to BSE also have been seen in elk, deer and exotic zoo animals. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities reported the first U.S. case of mad cow disease in six years on Tuesday and quickly assured consumers and global importers that meat from the California dairy cow did not enter the food chain. John Clifford, the USDA's chief veterinary officer, said the case was &quot;atypical&quot; and that there was &quot;no cause for alarm&quot; from the animal. Cows can contract the disease spontaneously in rare cases and that it cannot be transmitted unless the brain or spinal tissue is consumed by humans or another animal, according to scientists. ...
