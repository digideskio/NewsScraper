     <title>How Much Gold Would You Need to Recreate Scrooge McDuck's Gold Coin Swim?</title>
     <description>
      Scrooge McDuck, the miserly Scottish business tycoon in Disney's &quot;Duck universe&quot;, regularly appeared in the late-1980s Saturday morning cartoon &quot;Duck Tales&quot; taking leisurely swims through the sea of gold he kept in a private vault. It is surely the secret hope of us all that we, too, will someday amass enough gold to partake in this rich duck's sport. So, just how much gold would you need to recreate Scrooge's gold coin swim?

     <title>Asteroid Impacts Could Help out Underground Life</title>
     <description>
      An incoming asteroid is trouble whether you're a dinosaur or a Bruce Willis fan. But microbes living deep underground may actually welcome the news, according to a recent study of an ancient impact in the United States' Chesapeake Bay. A biological census of the subsurface life forms suggests that impacts create new niches for these deep dwellers to spread into.

     <title>Scientists call for rethink on consumption, population</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have called for a radical rethink of our relationship with the planet to head off what they warn could be economic and environmental catastrophe. In a report published on Thursday by the London-based Royal Society, an international group of 23 scientists chaired by Nobel laureate Sir John Sulston called for a rebalancing of consumption in favour of poor countries coupled with increased efforts to control population growth to lift the estimated 1.3 billion people living on less than $1.25 a day out of poverty. ...

      A mysterious fossil that has evoked images of a sea monster roaming the shallow waters of prehistoric Cincinnati may not be the remains of such a complex life form, but even so scientists are stumped as to what kind of creature (or sea plant) it was.

     <title>'Gaia' Scientist Takes Back Climate Change Predictions</title>
     <description>
      A scientist and author, James Lovelock, who once predicted doomsdaylike fallout from climate change has backtracked, calling his own projections and those of others &quot;alarmist.&quot; Even so, climate scientists stress Lovelock's backtracking doesn't negate the reality of climate change, and in fact, his past predictions highlight some overall misunderstanding about planetary warming.

     <title>Study: Antarctic ice melting from warm water below</title>
     <description>
      Antarctica's massive ice shelves are shrinking because they are being eaten away from below by warm water, a new study finds. That suggests that future sea levels could rise faster than many scientists have been predicting.

     <title>Sun-Like Star May Have More Planets Than Our Solar System</title>
     <description>
      A star already known to host five alien planets may actually be home to a whopping nine full-fledged worlds - a planetary arrangement that, if confirmed, would outnumber our own solar system and set a new record for the most populated system of extrasolar planets yet found.

     <title>3.2 Billion-Pixel Camera Telescope Gets Critical Go-Ahead</title>
     <description>
      Plans for an enormous telescope, equipped with a 3.2 billion-pixel camera, are ready for detailed designs, its creators announced today (April 24). When built, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will take photos of every inch of visible night sky every week for 10 years in a kind of time-lapse picture that will provide scientists with unparalleled views of the universe.&nbsp;

     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have called for a radical rethink of our relationship with the planet to head off what they warn could be economic and environmental catastrophe. In a report published on Thursday by the London-based Royal Society, an international group of 23 scientists chaired by Nobel laureate Sir John Sulston called for a rebalancing of consumption in favour of poor countries coupled with increased efforts to control population growth to lift the estimated 1.3 billion people living on less than $1.25 a day out of poverty. ...

     <title>Mysterious Sea Monster Plant Fossil Baffles Scientists</title>
     <description>
      A mysterious fossil that has evoked images of a sea monster roaming the shallow waters of prehistoric Cincinnati may not be the remains of such a complex life form, but even so scientists are stumped as to what kind of creature (or sea plant) it was.

     <title>'Gaia' Scientist Takes Back Climate Change Predictions</title>
     <description>
      A scientist and author, James Lovelock, who once predicted doomsdaylike fallout from climate change has backtracked, calling his own projections and those of others &quot;alarmist.&quot; Even so, climate scientists stress Lovelock's backtracking doesn't negate the reality of climate change, and in fact, his past predictions highlight some overall misunderstanding about planetary warming.
