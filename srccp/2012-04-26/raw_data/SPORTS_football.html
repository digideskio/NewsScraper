     <description>
      The NFL believes the players' union is more intent on protecting the New Orleans Saints involved in the team's bounty scandal than supporting its members who could have been hurt by the pay-for-pain plan.

Included in the package was a $3 million &quot;career bonus&quot; that was due to Paterno at retirement, which had been planned for the end of the 2011 season. Instead, he was fired with three games left to play in the regular season as the scandal involving former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky roiled the campus. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
