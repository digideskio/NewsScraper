     <title>As Supreme Court mulls healthcare, rumors fly</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - This week the U.S. Supreme Court wrapped up the last oral arguments of its current term.

The collective impatience is fueling a mini-industry of rumors, wagers and speculation not seen since the Bush v. Gore case of 2000, when a presidential election hung in the balance. ...

      PHOENIX (Reuters) - The lawyer for a convicted murderer executed in Arizona said on Thursday his client shook violently after a lethal injection drug was administered, and may call for an independent autopsy to determine if he experienced any pain. A defiant Thomas Kemp, 63, was executed on Wednesday by lethal injection at the state prison in Florence, about 60 miles southeast of Phoenix, for kidnapping and killing a Hispanic college student in 1992. His last words were: &quot;I regret nothing. ...
