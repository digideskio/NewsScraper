     <description>
      (Reuters) - Johnson &amp; Johnson is sending in a former Army Ranger to clean up several big messes that have hurt its reputation, earnings and share price in the past three years, and he takes charge on Thursday with uncertain odds.

After years of trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization, a diagnosis of breast cancer almost removed all hopes of having a biological child. This raises the question -- is pregnancy safe after a breast cancer diagnosis? Susan G. Komen for the Cure posted the results of a study authored by H. Azim Jr and L. Emeye, titled &quot;Pregnancy following estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is safe -- results from a large multi-center case-control study. ...

     <title>Obstructive Sleep Apnea Study Reveals Stroke Risk After 30 Days</title>
     <description>
      FIRST PERSON | Texas researchers have made a discovery bound to shock many patients suffering from a common but potentially fatal sleep disorder. The Baylor College of Medicine team found that after experiencing the disorder for just 30 days, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients could suffer a stroke. They've linked their results to changes in cerebral vessel function in middle-age or older men with OSA, according to ScienceDaily.

     <title>U.S. delays decision on Takeda diabetes drug</title>
     <description>

     <description>

     <title>Obstructive Sleep Apnea Study Reveals Stroke Risk After 30 Days</title>
     <description>
      FIRST PERSON | Texas researchers have made a discovery bound to shock many patients suffering from a common but potentially fatal sleep disorder. The Baylor College of Medicine team found that after experiencing the disorder for just 30 days, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients could suffer a stroke. They've linked their results to changes in cerebral vessel function in middle-age or older men with OSA, according to ScienceDaily.
