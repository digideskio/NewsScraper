     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Health insurers will pay $1.3 billion in rebates to consumers and employers this year under a provision of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law that penalizes plans that devote too little of their premium revenues to health services, an independent study showed on Thursday. The study, published by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said the data illustrated some of the tangible benefits that consumers and employers could expect from the embattled 2010 law if it survives two major legal and political election-year challenges. ...

The testimony came at the trial of Monsignor William Lynn, former secretary of the clergy, who is charged with child endangerment and conspiracy over accusations he covered up abuse allegations against priests, many of whom were simply transferred to unsuspecting parishes. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The audio recordings, made public in a 17-minute video later posted on YouTube, capture educators speaking in harsh tones to the autistic children, including one in which a woman tells the young boy what sounds like &quot;You are a bastard. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Part of Detroit's recent deal to mend its shattered finances could be threatened if Michigan officials on Thursday rule that a referendum to repeal the state's controversial emergency manager law should be allowed on the November ballot. A decision by election officials to allow the referendum to be put before voters on November 6 would result in a suspension of the law, pending an actual vote on the measure. Opponents of the law object to the power it grants to essentially replace local elected officials with an emergency manager during a financial crisis. ...

      PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona is poised to join next-door neighbor Utah in demanding the U.S. government transfer title to millions of acres of federal property to the state, fanning a renewed &quot;sagebrush revolt&quot; over control of public lands in the West. The Arizona state Senate, on a 19-9 vote, gave final legislative approval on Wednesday to a measure calling for federal agencies to relinquish roughly 48,000 square miles (124,000 sq km) of acreage they own in the Grand Canyon state by 2015. The Republican-backed bill was approved by the state House of Representatives on Monday. ...

      (Reuters) - A Navy airman behind a January murder-suicide in California came home from a New Year's celebration and lay in wait for a man and a woman he had partied with, shooting them before killing a fellow Navy lieutenant, police said on Wednesday. The motive for the killings by Navy Lieutenant John Reeves, 25, remained unclear, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said in a statement as they concluded their investigation. Police had found within days of the New Year's Day slayings that Reeves was responsible for killing the three people. ...

Ellis County Justice of the Peace Bill Woody said a report from the Dallas County medical examiner's office indicates that the remains are those of Johnathan Ramsey. Police began searching for the boy in March after arresting his father and stepmother in connection with the boy's disappearance. ...

Thomas Kemp, 63, was pronounced dead at 10:08 a.m. local time at the state prison in Florence, about 60 miles southeast of Phoenix, a state official said.

Chesapeake lost control of the well late on Tuesday while installing a casing, which triggered the leak, the company said in a statement. It wasn't clear how much gas or fluid escaped the well. Local TV reports said the sound of natural gas rushing from the ground could be heard miles away. ...

     <description>

The study, published by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said the data illustrated some of the tangible benefits that consumers and employers could expect from the embattled 2010 law if it survives two major legal and political election-year challenges. ...

     <title>California sailing accident survivor urges new safety rules</title>
     <description>
      TIBURON, California (Reuters) - One of three survivors from a fatal California yacht wreck said the moments he spent overboard felt like he was in &quot;a washing machine filled with boulders,&quot; and that five crew mates who died might have been saved had they worn safety harnesses. In a letter posted to the website Sailing Anarchy, Bryan Chong of Tiburon, California, said he and the seven other sailors aboard the 38-foot (11.6-meter) Low Speed Chase should have been tethered to the boat. ...

     <title>As Supreme Court mulls healthcare, rumors fly</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - This week the U.S. Supreme Court wrapped up the last oral arguments of its current term. Now comes the nationwide angst of waiting - as long as two months - for decisions, particularly the one that will resolve the most high-stakes and closely watched case of the year: the challenge to the Obama-sponsored healthcare law. The collective impatience is fueling a mini-industry of rumors, wagers and speculation not seen since the Bush v. Gore case of 2000, when a presidential election hung in the balance. ...

     <title>Crane owner acquitted in fatal Manhattan accident</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Manhattan state judge on Thursday acquitted a construction company owner of manslaughter for a crane collapse that killed two workers in May, 2008 and raised fears about high-level building projects in New York. James Lomma, who owned the nearly 200-foot-tall crane that snapped in half and crashed onto a building on the Upper East Side, was acquitted of all charges. His companies, New York Crane &amp; Equipment Corp. and J.F. Lomma, were also acquitted. The accident came two months after another crane operated by Lomma's company in Manhattan collapsed and killed seven ...

     <description>
      PHOENIX (Reuters) - The lawyer for a convicted murderer executed in Arizona said on Thursday his client shook violently after a lethal injection drug was administered, and may call for an independent autopsy to determine if he experienced any pain. A defiant Thomas Kemp, 63, was executed on Wednesday by lethal injection at the state prison in Florence, about 60 miles southeast of Phoenix, for kidnapping and killing a Hispanic college student in 1992. His last words were: &quot;I regret nothing. ...

      LANSING, Michigan (Reuters) - A proposed repeal of Michigan's controversial emergency manager law, aimed at repairing finances in struggling cities and school districts, failed to make the November ballot after a tie vote by a four-member state elections panel on Thursday. The commission's decision had been keenly awaited because a vote to let the referendum be put before voters would have suspended the emergency manager law pending the outcome of the vote. ...

Their fund returned 39.7 percent over the first three months of this year, a full 8.6 percentage points more than its closest competitor, the $8.4 billion Fairholme fund managed by famed investor Bruce Berkowitz, according to Morningstar data. ...

     <title>Illinois man's ire over Martin case prompts hate crime -police</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - An 18-year-old black man has been charged with a hate crime after he told police he punched and kicked a white man during a robbery in a Chicago suburb because he was angry about the Trayvon Martin slaying, authorities said on Thursday. Alton Hayes III and a 15-year-old boy attacked the man last week in Oak Park, Illinois. Hayes told police he chose the man because he was white and beat him because he was angry about the Martin case, Andy Conklin of the Cook County prosecutor's office said. ...

     <title>Health insurers to pay $1.3 billion in rebates: study</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Health insurers will pay $1.3 billion in rebates to consumers and employers this year under a provision of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law that penalizes plans that devote too little of their premium revenues to health services, an independent study showed on Thursday. The study, published by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said the data illustrated some of the tangible benefits that consumers and employers could expect from the embattled 2010 law if it survives two major legal and political election-year challenges. ...

     <title>U.S. on guard for attacks ahead of bin Laden anniversary</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has reviewed potential threats to the United States ahead of the anniversary next week of the killing of Osama bin Laden, but there is no concrete evidence that al Qaeda is plotting any revenge attacks, the White House said on Thursday. Bin Laden's killing last year by U.S. commandos is touted by the Obama administration as one of his top accomplishments and it may help inoculate the president from Republican election-year claims that he is weak on national security. U.S. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New Jersey school district has fired at least two educators for verbally abusing autistic children after a father sent his 10-year-old autistic son to school wearing a hidden microphone upon suspecting he was being mistreated by staff.

     <title>Navy airman ambushed victims in California slayings, police say</title>
     <description>
      SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - A Navy airman behind a January murder-suicide in California came home from a New Year's celebration and lay in wait for a man and a woman he had partied with, shooting them before killing a fellow Navy lieutenant and them himself, authorities said on Wednesday. The motive for the killings by Navy Lieutenant John Reeves, 25, remained unclear, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said in a statement as they concluded their investigation. Police said they had learned within days of the New Year's Day slayings that Reeves was responsible for killing the three people. ...

     <title>As Supreme Court mulls healthcare, rumors fly</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - This week the U.S. Supreme Court wrapped up the last oral arguments of its current term. Now comes the nationwide angst of waiting - as long as two months - for decisions, particularly the one that will resolve the most high-stakes and closely watched case of the year: the challenge to the Obama-sponsored healthcare law. The collective impatience is fueling a mini-industry of rumors, wagers and speculation not seen since the Bush v. Gore case of 2000, when a presidential election hung in the balance. ...

     <title>Lawyer says Arizona inmate shook violently during execution</title>
     <description>
      PHOENIX (Reuters) - The lawyer for a convicted murderer executed in Arizona said on Thursday his client shook violently after a lethal injection drug was administered, and may call for an independent autopsy to determine if he experienced any pain. A defiant Thomas Kemp, 63, was executed on Wednesday by lethal injection at the state prison in Florence, about 60 miles southeast of Phoenix, for kidnapping and killing a Hispanic college student in 1992. His last words were: &quot;I regret nothing. ...

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has reviewed potential threats to the United States ahead of the anniversary next week of the killing of Osama bin Laden, but there is no concrete evidence that al Qaeda is plotting any revenge attacks, the White House said on Thursday. Bin Laden's killing last year by U.S. commandos is touted by the Obama administration as one of his top accomplishments and it may help inoculate the president from Republican election-year claims that he is weak on national security.

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Manhattan state judge on Thursday acquitted a construction company owner of manslaughter for a crane collapse that killed two workers in May, 2008 and raised fears about high-level building projects in New York. James Lomma, who owned the nearly 200-foot-tall crane that snapped in half and crashed onto a building on the Upper East Side, was acquitted of all charges. His companies, New York Crane &amp; Equipment Corp. and J.F. Lomma, were also acquitted. The accident came two months after another crane operated by Lomma's company in Manhattan collapsed and killed seven ...
