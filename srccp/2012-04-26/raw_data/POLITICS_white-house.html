     <title>Rubio’s Gift to Romney on Immigration</title>
     <description>
      Even if he doesn’t get tapped as Mitt Romney’s running mate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is well-positioned to make his mark on the race. His push for an alternate Dream Act, legalizing the children of some illegal immigrants, is getting serious consideration from immigrant advocates, including traditional Democratic allies. It’s putting the White House on the defensive over whether to oppose a measure that could end up being embraced by many in the Hispanic community.

     <description>
      The White House today threatened a veto of the controversial Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) if the bill reaches President Obama's desk in its present form. In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, the Executive Office of the President expressed concern over the lack of privacy safeguards in the CISPA bill and said it &quot;strongly opposes&quot; H.R. 3523 as written.

     <title>Voters Already Know November Will Bring a Close Election</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The November election for the White House is months away still, and yet the analysts and hopefuls are already starting to circle the wagons with regards to the election. The Ticket is reporting that 100 electoral votes will decide the contest, because as the report reminds us it takes 270 electoral votes to win the majority. However, Americans do not need exhaustive coverage about a close election, because everybody pretty much knew that already.

     <title>Obama Woos the Celeb-Smitten, but They Want Jobs</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Want a hipster in the White House? President Obama's pretty sure you do. In just four months, he's devoted quite a bit of time to all things celeb: he &quot;slow jammed the news&quot; with Jimmy Fallon, sang a clip from Al Green's &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; at Harlem's Apollo Theater, wrote a happy birthday letter to &quot;It Girl&quot; and indie rocker Zooey Deschanel, and recorded a minute-long video wishing Betty White a Happy 90th birthday that ends with him listening to the &quot;Golden Girls&quot; theme song on his iPod. Yes, we have a cool president.

     <title>Lindsay Lohan Storm Rolls Toward White House Correspondents’ Dinner</title>
     <description>
      Lindsay Lohan's verbal lashing from outspoken Rosie O'Donnell has done little to curb the starlet's interest-piquing appeal. Despite Lohan's countless court battles and addiction woes, she is a headline-grabbing, ratings-booster everyone is willing to cash in on. This could explain Lohan's invitation to the White House Correspondents' Dinner by Fox News correspondent Greta Van Susteren.
