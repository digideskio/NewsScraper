     <title>Globalive wins court battle over foreign control</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - A long-running Canadian legal battle ended on Thursday when the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to a government decision to allow Globalive to offer wireless services in Canada despite its close ties to a foreign company. The decision was a setback for Public Mobile, a Globalive rival that also offers a low-cost wireless service, and Canada's telecoms regulator, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. ...

     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Husky Energy Inc was still processing about 120,000 barrels per day of fuel at its Lima, Ohio refinery after a leak shut down a unit, an executive said Thursday. Repairs at the plant, which has a capacity of 155,000 bpd, should take two to seven days to complete, Bob Baird, vice president of downstream for Husky, said in a conference call.

     <title>Teranet index shows Canadian home prices cooling</title>
     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian home resale prices sagged in February from January, the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index showed on Wednesday, and the pace of year-over-year growth has slowed. The index, which measures price changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed prices fell 0.2 percent in February from January, in a modest cooling of what has been a hot market across much of Canada. It was the third decline in four months. The index was up 6.1 percent in February from February 2011, but that was down from January's 6.5 percent year-on-year rise. ...

     <title>Canada to appeal ruling that permits brothels</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's federal government will seek to appeal a court ruling that effectively legalized brothels across the country, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said on Wednesday. The top court in the province of Ontario last month struck down a section of the Criminal Code that bars brothels, saying that forcing sex workers to stay on the street made it hard for them to take safety precautions. The judges also upheld a section of the code that restricts street prostitution. Accepting money in return for sex is not illegal in Canada, but most related activities are. ...

      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Alberta remains a strong supporter of its oil industry after a provincial election that left the Progressive Conservatives in power to focus on new markets for Canadian crude and to try to persuade Washington to let the Keystone XL Pipeline go ahead. The Conservatives, led by Alison Redford, won 61 of 87 seats in the provincial legislature in Monday's election, capturing 44 percent of the popular vote despite lagging in opinion polls throughout the campaign. ...

      VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A worker at a British Columbia sawmill was killed and 23 others were injured when the plant burst into flames on Monday night in the second deadly mill fire in the Western Canadian province this year. The cause of the explosion at the Lakeland sawmill in Prince George, 750 km (469 miles) north of Vancouver, has yet to be determined, Barb McLintock, a spokeswoman for the provincial coroner's office, said on Tuesday. The mill, owned by closely held Sinclair Group Forest Products, would have to cool down for 24 to 48 hours before investigators could enter, she said. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Precision Drilling Corp's, Canada's No. 1 oil and gas driller, quarterly profit narrowly missed analysts estimates as an unusually warm winter led to lower rig utilization in the country. The warm weather in Canada delayed winter season drilling and the annual spring break-up arrived earlier, resulting in lower average utilization rates for the quarter, the company said. ...

     <title>Canadian bank sees higher growth for farm sector</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Canada's farm sector is in line for better than average growth in 2012 and beyond due to rising demand from fast-growing emerging markets like China and India, the Bank of Montreal (BMO) said on Thursday. The sector will expand by 2.5 to 3 percent in 2012 and in subsequent years by 2 to 3 percent, the Canadian lender said in a report. The growth figure is based on projected production and prices. Canada is the top producer of canola/rapeseed and the seventh-biggest wheat grower in the world. ...

      OTTAWA (Reuters) - In a further effort to prevent the housing market from getting overheated, Canada's bank regulator will oversee the commercial activities of the federal housing agency under legislation introduced by the government on Thursday. In announcing the legislation, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said he was giving the bank regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), the job of making sure that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp (CMHC) doesn't stoke an already hot market. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude futures extended gains to more than $1 on Thursday, pushing above $120 a barrel as Wall Street equities and oil received a boost from data showing contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes increased to a near two-year high in March. Brent June crude was up 88 cents at $120 a barrel at 10:53 a.m. EDT (1453 GMT), having traded from $118.78 to $120.17. (Reporting by Robert Gibbons; Editing by Alden Bentley)

     <title>Canada seeks C$900 million or more in spectrum auction</title>
     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada aims to raise a minimum of nearly C$900 million through an auction of valuable wireless spectrum, based on ground rules published by the government this week, though the sale could bring in far more as carriers vie for the frequencies. The online document spelling out the rules marks the start of a months-long consultation process that will bed down the finer points of an auction that will shape the wireless industry for years to come. The sale is scheduled for early next year. ...

     <title>Canada to appeal ruling that permits brothels</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's federal government will seek to appeal a court ruling that effectively legalized brothels across the country, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said on Wednesday. The top court in the province of Ontario last month struck down a section of the Criminal Code that bars brothels, saying that forcing sex workers to stay on the street made it hard for them to take safety precautions. The judges also upheld a section of the code that restricts street prostitution. Accepting money in return for sex is not illegal in Canada, but most related activities are. ...

      TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian home resale prices sagged in February from January, the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index showed on Wednesday, and the pace of year-over-year growth has slowed. The index, which measures price changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed prices fell 0.2 percent in February from January, in a modest cooling of what has been a hot market across much of Canada. It was the third decline in four months. The index was up 6.1 percent in February from February 2011, but that was down from January's 6.5 percent year-on-year rise. ...

     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Moody's downgraded Ontario's debt on Thursday following its negative outlook on the province a few months ago, just a day after competitor Standard &amp; Poor's put Canada's most populous province on negative watch. Moody's dropped Ontario's issuer and debt ratings to Aa2 from Aa1, with a stable outlook, bringing its score on the province more in line with the other two big rating agencies, S&amp;P and DBRS.

COMMENTARY: RONALD JOSEY, ANALYST, THINKEQUITY &quot;What jumped out to me was the gross profit, growth as well as their overall operating income margins of 3 percent relative to where expectations were. Net, net is: a much better topline than we were expecting and a much, much better bottomline. &quot;The company is certainly performing incredibly well. ...
