     <title>Pope stakes out church's course entering 8th year</title>
     <description>
      Pope Benedict XVI began his eighth year as pope on Tuesday after spending the waning days of his seventh driving home his view of the Catholic Church, with a divisive crackdown on dissenters and an equally divisive opening to a fringe group of traditionalists.

But no, Grenell has done something unforgivable to the American Family Associations's Bryan Fischer and Media Research Center's Dan Gainor: Be an openly gay person.

     <title>Pope stakes out church's course entering 8th year</title>
     <description>
      Pope Benedict XVI began his eighth year as pope on Tuesday after spending the waning days of his seventh driving home his view of the Catholic Church, with a divisive crackdown on dissenters and an equally divisive opening to a fringe group of traditionalists.
