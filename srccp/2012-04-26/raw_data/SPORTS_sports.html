     <title>Saudi girls school defies clerics with basketball: paper</title>
     <description>
      JEDDAH (Reuters) - A girls' school in Saudi Arabia has defied a religious ban on female sports by erecting basketball hoops and letting pupils play at break-time, the daily al-Watan reported on Wednesday.
