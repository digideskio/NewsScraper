     <title>Meet the man who sells testicular implants for dogs, “People thought I was nuts”</title>
     <description>
      Gregg Miller says he's well aware that his business selling testicular implants for dogs invites just as many jokes as it does clients. That's because Miller's job is creating artificial dog testicles for canines that have been neutered. &quot;Dogs aren't stupid,&quot; he tells Business Week. &quot;They would know if their eye was gouged out, or [...]

     <description>
      INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - Police in a small Indiana town hauled a six-year-old from his elementary school and charged him with battery and intimidation after he kicked and threatened a principal, police said on Wednesday.

     <title>HIV-positive man fights charge that saliva was deadly</title>
     <description>
      ALBANY, New York (Reuters) - A gay-rights group is urging New York state's high court to overturn the conviction of an HIV-positive man whose saliva was found to be a &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; in a biting case. David Plunkett was sentenced in 2007 to 10 years in prison for aggravated assault, a felony that requires the use of a &quot;dangerous instrument.&quot; Plunkett argued unsuccessfully the charge could not be sustained because HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva. The Court of Appeals, New York's top court, will hear Plunkett's case on Thursday. ...

     <description>
      KIEV (Reuters) - Two valuable paintings in the offices of the Ukrainian government have been mysteriously swapped for replicas, the former Soviet republic's Culture Ministry said on Wednesday. The landscape paintings by 20th century Ukrainian artist Mykola Hlushchenko have been on display in the government building since August 2001. &quot;Chemical tests have shown that both paintings are replicas of Hlushchenko's works,&quot; the ministry said in a statement. Insurers have valued the paintings at about $144,000 combined. The ministry said the replicas appeared to be 5-10 years old. ...

What's arguably most interesting about the pizza mashups (there's also one featuring chicken fingers) is that none of them are currently being offered in the U.S. [...]

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York woman who donated a kidney so her ailing boss would move up the transplant waiting list says she was fired shortly after the operation, according to a complaint she filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights. Deborah Stevens said her former employer, Atlantic Automotive Group, discriminated against her over disabilities brought about by complications from the surgery, and she plans to sue the company for lost earnings and damages. The company, which runs car dealerships on Long Island, said Stevens's complaint is groundless. ...

     <description>
      JEDDAH (Reuters) - A Saudi Arabian man who was jailed for three years in 1997 has spent a further 12 years behind bars waiting for his father to pardon him, a local human rights group has said.

     <title>Kyrgyzstan gas company extinguishes ‘Eternal Flame’ due to unpaid Bill</title>

      It is unwise to test the patience of Bishkek's gas-supply services. A power company in Kyrgyzstan recently extinguished the former Soviet nation's &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; because of an unpaid gas bill. That might sound downright unpatriotic, but in fairness to the gas company, it was a pretty big bill; the government owed around $9,400. The debt, [...]

      Gregg Miller says he's well aware that his business selling testicular implants for dogs invites just as many jokes as it does clients. That's because Miller's job is creating artificial dog testicles for canines that have been neutered. &quot;Dogs aren't stupid,&quot; he tells Business Week. &quot;They would know if their eye was gouged out, or [...]

     <title>HIV-positive man fights charge that saliva was deadly</title>
     <description>
      ALBANY, New York (Reuters) - A gay-rights group is urging New York state's high court to overturn the conviction of an HIV-positive man whose saliva was found to be a &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; in a biting case. David Plunkett was sentenced in 2007 to 10 years in prison for aggravated assault, a felony that requires the use of a &quot;dangerous instrument.&quot; Plunkett argued unsuccessfully the charge could not be sustained because HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva. The Court of Appeals, New York's top court, will hear Plunkett's case on Thursday. ...

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York woman who donated a kidney so her ailing boss would move up the transplant waiting list says she was fired shortly after the operation, according to a complaint she filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights. Deborah Stevens said her former employer, Atlantic Automotive Group, discriminated against her over disabilities brought about by complications from the surgery, and she plans to sue the company for lost earnings and damages. The company, which runs car dealerships on Long Island, said Stevens's complaint is groundless. ...
