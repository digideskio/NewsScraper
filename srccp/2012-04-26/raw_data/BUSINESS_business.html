While most corporate results topped expectations, some high-profile misses, including from Exxon and Aetna, kept a lid on gains. Pending home sales rose to a near two-year high in March, but investors also had to contend with data showing a stumbling labor recovery as weekly initial jobless claims fell slightly but missed forecasts. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 1,000 to 388,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. &quot;This was a disappointing number and offers more evidence that the labor market continues to lose traction,&quot; said Joe Manimbo, an analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. Economists polled by Reuters had expected new claims to fall to 375,000. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Exxon's oil and natural gas production slumped 5 percent in the first quarter, leading to a lower net profit and pushing its shares down 1.7 percent -- an especially big move for a $400 billion company that just increased its dividend the previous day by a better-than-expected 21 percent. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it was still evaluating how many jobs it would cut in a cost-reduction program after a newspaper reported Germany's biggest airline planned to slash about 3,000 administrative staff. German mass-circulation paper Bild earlier reported that Lufthansa planned to cut half of a total of 6,000 administrative jobs around the world, with 1,500 jobs to go in Frankfurt.

      LONDON (Reuters) - Consumer goods giant Unilever beat forecasts with an 8.4 percent rise in first-quarter sales on Thursday, helped by price hikes and emerging market growth. The Anglo-Dutch maker of brands like Dove and Knorr is battling high input costs from rising commodity prices such as crude and vegetable oils, and slow growth in developed nations. It also cautioned that emerging market growth has started to slow especially in eastern Europe and Russia. ...

     <title>MetLife posts loss on interest rate bet</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - MetLife , the largest life insurer in the United States, posted a net loss for the first quarter on huge derivative losses tied to a rise in interest rates. But operating results beat expectations on growth in all three of its geographic regions. MetLife accidentally released preliminary figures last week, so the broad outlines of results were already known. The company said on Thursday it lost $174 million, or 16 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $701 million or 66 cents per share. On an operating basis MetLife earned $1.37 per share. ...

Exxon's oil and natural gas production slumped 5 percent in the first quarter, leading to a lower net profit and pushing its shares down 1.7 percent -- an especially big move for a $400 billion company that just increased its dividend the previous day by a better-than-expected 21 percent. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in March, jumped 4.1 percent to 101.4, the highest level since April 2010. Economists polled by Reuters had expected signed contracts, which lead existing home sales by a month or two, to rise 1.0 percent after a previously reported 0.5 percent fall. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
