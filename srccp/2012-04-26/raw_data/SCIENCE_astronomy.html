     <title>Asteroid Impacts Could Help out Underground Life</title>
     <description>
      An incoming asteroid is trouble whether you're a dinosaur or a Bruce Willis fan. But microbes living deep underground may actually welcome the news, according to a recent study of an ancient impact in the United States' Chesapeake Bay. A biological census of the subsurface life forms suggests that impacts create new niches for these deep dwellers to spread into.

     <title>Rare Daytime Fireball Created by Minivan-Size Space Rock</title>
     <description>
      A surprise space rock explosion that lit up the daytime sky over parts of California and Nevada this week was no tiny meteor. NASA scientists say the fireball was created by a minivan-size asteroid that triggered a loud sonic boom as it broke apart and streaked through Earth's atmosphere.

     <title>Asteroids Battered Young Earth Longer Than Thought</title>
     <description>
      A giant ancient barrage of asteroids striking Earth may have lasted much longer than previously thought, with some collisions perhaps even rivaling those that created the largest craters on the moon, researchers say.

     <title>3.2 Billion-Pixel Camera Telescope Gets Critical Go-Ahead</title>
     <description>
      Plans for an enormous telescope, equipped with a 3.2 billion-pixel camera, are ready for detailed designs, its creators announced today (April 24). When built, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will take photos of every inch of visible night sky every week for 10 years in a kind of time-lapse picture that will provide scientists with unparalleled views of the universe.&nbsp;

     <title>Asteroid Impacts Could Help out Underground Life</title>
     <description>
      An incoming asteroid is trouble whether you're a dinosaur or a Bruce Willis fan. But microbes living deep underground may actually welcome the news, according to a recent study of an ancient impact in the United States' Chesapeake Bay. A biological census of the subsurface life forms suggests that impacts create new niches for these deep dwellers to spread into.

     <title>Rare Daytime Fireball Created by Minivan-Size Space Rock</title>
     <description>
      A surprise space rock explosion that lit up the daytime sky over parts of California and Nevada this week was no tiny meteor. NASA scientists say the fireball was created by a minivan-size asteroid that triggered a loud sonic boom as it broke apart and streaked through Earth's atmosphere.
