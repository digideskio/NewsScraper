     <title>'Gaia' Scientist Takes Back Climate Change Predictions</title>
     <description>
      A scientist and author, James Lovelock, who once predicted doomsdaylike fallout from climate change has backtracked, calling his own projections and those of others &quot;alarmist.&quot; Even so, climate scientists stress Lovelock's backtracking doesn't negate the reality of climate change, and in fact, his past predictions highlight some overall misunderstanding about planetary warming.

     <description>
      RABAT (Reuters) - Morocco's cereals harvest should reach 4.8 million tonnes this year, the agriculture minister said on Tuesday, which is above the most recent forecasts, but far below last year's level and the crop budget for 2012. Aziz Akhannouch said the decline was due to bad weather conditions, according to remarks carried by the official MAP news agency. He did not give a breakdown per variety.

     <title>No Warm Feelings for 'Frozen Planet'; Fish Labels Are Fishy</title>
     <description>
      The New York Times on the controversy surrounding Frozen Planet Irony alert: for all the sharp, HD details of Frozen Planet, one of those stunning nature documentaries cut from the same cloth as Planet Earth, it glosses over something awfully big: why the Earth is warming. As Brian Stelter explains, the series adresses how Arctic and Antarctic creatures have been affected by global warming without getting into the reasons why the world's heating up -- i.e., man-made carbon emissions. ...

     <title>'Gaia' Scientist Takes Back Climate Change Predictions</title>
     <description>
      A scientist and author, James Lovelock, who once predicted doomsdaylike fallout from climate change has backtracked, calling his own projections and those of others &quot;alarmist.&quot; Even so, climate scientists stress Lovelock's backtracking doesn't negate the reality of climate change, and in fact, his past predictions highlight some overall misunderstanding about planetary warming.
