The 81-year-old media mogul was facing a second day of grilling at the Leveson Inquiry, which has heard dozens of witnesses give detailed accounts of being harassed by reporters from Murdoch's own newspapers. ...

The survey was released one day after Rolling Stone magazine published an interview with President Barack Obama in which he suggested that climate change would become a campaign issue this year. ...

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Health insurers will pay $1.3 billion in rebates to consumers and employers this year under a provision of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law that penalizes plans that devote too little of their premium revenues to health services, an independent study showed on Thursday. The study, published by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said the data illustrated some of the tangible benefits that consumers and employers could expect from the embattled 2010 law if it survives two major legal and political election-year challenges. ...

     <title>New Syrian group claims legitimacy, rivals SNC</title>
     <description>
      PARIS (Reuters) - A group of opponents to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, including members of armed factions in the country, will unveil an interim government on Thursday and claim that unlike the Syrian National Council (SNC) it will have legitimacy in Syria. Disunity among the Syrian opposition and criticism that the SNC does not represent all strands of society have fed fears that Syria could slide into sectarian conflict, much as Iraq did after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. ...

     <description>
      CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's election committee announced on Thursday that Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister could run for president after all, only two days after it had disqualified him, stoking confusion before next month's vote to replace the deposed president. Ahmed Shafiq, a former air force chief, had been ruled out under a law passed by the Islamist-led parliament stripping political rights from top Mubarak-era figures. But after the committee accepted his appeal, it confirmed him as one of 13 approved candidates. It had excluded 10 others last week. ...

     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Moody's downgraded Ontario's debt on Thursday following its negative outlook on the province a few months ago, just a day after competitor Standard &amp; Poor's put Canada's most populous province on negative watch. Moody's dropped Ontario's issuer and debt ratings to Aa2 from Aa1, with a stable outlook, bringing its score on the province more in line with the other two big rating agencies, S&amp;P and DBRS.

Nearly every lawmaker who testified at a panel on the individual merits of $35 billion in tax breaks came out in favor of making their pet provisions permanent. Tax breaks - ranging from a popular corporate research credit to a subsidy for Puerto Rico that critics say benefits big rum producers - were the topic before a tax-writing subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives. ...
