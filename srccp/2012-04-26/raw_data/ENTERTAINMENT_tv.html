CBS Television Distribution is suing ComStar Media and FamilyNet for allegedly airing several series, including &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Family Ties,&quot; without paying licensing fees for the programs. CBS is seeking more than $1.5 million in the suit, which was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in California. ...

Advertising Age recently teamed with social-media monitoring firm Trendrr in an effort to determine which show is creating the most buzz in the social-media world.
