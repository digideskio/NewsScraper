     <title>Wall St stalls after weaker jobs data</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stalled on Thursday following the Nasdaq's biggest gains this year as new jobless claims missed forecasts in another sign that recent improvement in the labor market may be easing. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped by 1,000 to 388,000, while analysts expected 375,000 filings.

The exchange operator said it plans to implement cost reductions, including job cuts, as it adjusts to the low volume environment. Nasdaq said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 13 cents a share, a 2 percent yield, reflecting its strong cash flow and capital generation. It also said it would continue to repurchase shares. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Nasdaq said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 13 cents a share, a 2 percent yield, reflecting its strong cash flow and capital generation. It also said it would continue to repurchase shares. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc posted a higher-than-expected profit, boosted by high-speed Internet growth, but a contraction in its video business saw its shares pull back as some investors sold after gains of nearly 25 percent this year.

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stalled on Thursday following the Nasdaq's biggest gains this year as new jobless claims missed forecasts in another sign that recent improvement in the labor market may be easing. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped by 1,000 to 388,000, while analysts expected 375,000 filings. The prior week's number was revised up. &quot;They came in a lot higher than expected, which probably is raising a bit of concern again,&quot; said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst with PFG Best in Chicago. ...
