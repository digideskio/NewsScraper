     <title>Shillingford enjoys home comforts to restrict Australia</title>
     <description>
      ROSEAU, Dominica (Reuters) - West Indies off-spinner Shane Shillingford ran through Australia's middle order on the first day of the third test on Monday before admitting his surprise over how much purchase he gained on his home track. It is only the second test match to be played in Shillingford's homeland of Dominica and while no-one knows Windsor Park better than the 29-year-old, he said he was not expecting to get so much bounce and turn so quickly. &quot;I normally get a good amount of bounce but usually on the second or third day, not on the first. ...

     <title>Australia consolidate after early loss of Cowan</title>
     <description>
      ROSEAU, Dominica (Reuters) - Australia consolidated after losing opener Ed Cowan early on to reach 69 for one at lunch on the first day of the third and final test at Windsor Park on Monday. West Indies paceman Ravi Rampaul, drafted in for the injured Fidel Edwards, struck with his second ball as Cowan (one) offered no shot to a sharp inswinger in the second over and was trapped leg before. Rampaul, generating some impressive pace as well as his trademark movement off the pitch, should also have removed Australia's other opener. ...

     <title>No Warm Feelings for 'Frozen Planet'; Fish Labels Are Fishy</title>
     <description>
      The New York Times on the controversy surrounding Frozen Planet Irony alert: for all the sharp, HD details of Frozen Planet, one of those stunning nature documentaries cut from the same cloth as Planet Earth, it glosses over something awfully big: why the Earth is warming. As Brian Stelter explains, the series adresses how Arctic and Antarctic creatures have been affected by global warming without getting into the reasons why the world's heating up -- i.e., man-made carbon emissions. ...

     <description>
      MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian flu drug maker Biota Holdings has agreed to take over U.S. firm Nabi Biopharmaceuticals to create a $258 million group and move to the United States, where investors value biotech research more highly than in Australia. Nabi effectively put itself up for sale after its shares crashed last July as its experimental vaccine against nicotine addiction failed to meet its main target in late stage trials. ...

     <title>A disappointing &quot;Hobbit&quot; debuts at CinemaCon</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Peter Jackson hoped that an extended look at his upcoming &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot; would convince the theater owners who flocked to CinemaCon this week that higher frame rates was the next revolution in film. Based on the roughly 10 minutes he screened, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; director may need to work on his pitch. In a taped segment, Jackson, who is in New Zealand editing the prequel, said that raising the rate at which film is projected from 24 to 48 frames per second will enhance the 3D experience. ...

      ROSEAU, Dominica (Reuters) - - Wicketkeeper Matthew Wade struck a sparkling maiden test century as Australia rallied to 328 all out before lunch on the second day of the third and final test against West Indies on Tuesday.

      ROSEAU, Dominica (Reuters) - West Indies off-spinner Shane Shillingford ran through Australia's middle order on the first day of the third test on Monday before admitting his surprise over how much purchase he gained on his home track. It is only the second test match to be played in Shillingford's homeland of Dominica and while no-one knows Windsor Park better than the 29-year-old, he said he was not expecting to get so much bounce and turn so quickly. &quot;I normally get a good amount of bounce but usually on the second or third day, not on the first. ...

     <description>
      ROSEAU, Dominica (Reuters) - Australia consolidated after losing opener Ed Cowan early on to reach 69 for one at lunch on the first day of the third and final test at Windsor Park on Monday. West Indies paceman Ravi Rampaul, drafted in for the injured Fidel Edwards, struck with his second ball as Cowan (one) offered no shot to a sharp inswinger in the second over and was trapped leg before. Rampaul, generating some impressive pace as well as his trademark movement off the pitch, should also have removed Australia's other opener. ...

     <title>No Warm Feelings for 'Frozen Planet'; Fish Labels Are Fishy</title>
     <description>
      The New York Times on the controversy surrounding Frozen Planet Irony alert: for all the sharp, HD details of Frozen Planet, one of those stunning nature documentaries cut from the same cloth as Planet Earth, it glosses over something awfully big: why the Earth is warming. As Brian Stelter explains, the series adresses how Arctic and Antarctic creatures have been affected by global warming without getting into the reasons why the world's heating up -- i.e., man-made carbon emissions. ...
