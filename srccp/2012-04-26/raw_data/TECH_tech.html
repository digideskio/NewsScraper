     <title>Fancy Android app is comparable to the uber-popular Pinterest</title>
     <description>
      Fancy this, fancy that, and keep it all in the free Fancy app for Android. This app is designed for curators of style and those who love to live the high life. The Fancy app is like browsing through a free magazine filled with all your heart’s desires. The app’s modern design scheme is very user friendly, simple to use, and aesthetically appealing. I would classify it as what Gowalla is to FourSquare, Fancy is to Pinterest.

Canada's Supreme Court declined on Thursday to hear a challenge to a government decision to allow Globalive to operate in Canada despite close ties to a foreign company, initially Egypt's Orascom Telecom Holding SAE but now Russia's Vimpelcom Ltd. ...
