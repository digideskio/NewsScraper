      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Wednesday, with Apple's surge giving the Nasdaq its biggest gain of the year, while the Fed chairman reassured markets that the central bank would do more if necessary to lift the economy. Apple Inc fueled optimism that the current earnings season would be much stronger than expected, generating gains across all market sectors. The iPad and iPhone maker's results, released after Tuesday's closing bell, showed that its quarterly profits nearly doubled, while its revenue easily topped expectations. ...

     <title>Analysis: Still in the frame, the camera defies smartphone onslaught</title>
     <description>
      SINGAPORE (Reuters) - While most attention in the gadget world is on the breakneck pace of innovation in mobile phones, tablets and computers, another device has resolutely refused to die: the camera. Despite the onslaught of camera phones — the iPhone 4 has this year become the most popular device for posting snaps to the photo-sharing website Flickr — cameras are still being sold. Japan, the world's largest manufacturer, shipped nearly three times as many cameras in January as it did in the same month of 2003, when the camera phone was still in its infancy. ...

     <title>Dow, S&amp;P rise on earnings, Apple jumps late</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 rose on Tuesday after strong earnings and upbeat outlooks from big manufacturers like 3M Co, but Apple's slide ahead of its results drove the Nasdaq down. Shares of Apple Inc, however, reversed course after the bell when the iPad maker reported quarterly revenue that handily beat Wall Street's estimates. Apple's stock jumped 6.9 percent to $599 in extended trading after closing at $560.28, down 2 percent. The stock of the world's most valuable company has fallen in recent weeks after its huge run higher. ...

Shares in Apple, the world's most valuable technology company, shot 7 percent higher after the bell, recouping some losses from the past two weeks that had stemmed from concerns that iPhone sales growth rates could not be maintained. While iPad sales were a little lighter than expected, fiscal second-quarter revenue jumped to $39. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Shares in Apple, the world's most valuable technology company, shot 7 percent higher after the bell, recouping some losses from the past two weeks that had stemmed from concerns that iPhone sales growth rates could not be maintained.

     <title>Apple's Q2 iPad Sales Weren't So Insanely Great</title>
     <description>
      Despite the gloom surrounding its stock price of late, Apple delivered another blowout quarter on Tuesday, thanks in large part to iPhone sales. But if you took the iPhone out of the equation, the overall numbers were just OK as Macs had a so-so quarter and iPad sales fell on the low end of estimates.

     <title>Analysis: Still in the frame, the camera defies smartphone onslaught</title>
     <description>
      SINGAPORE (Reuters) - While most attention in the gadget world is on the breakneck pace of innovation in mobile phones, tablets and computers, another device has resolutely refused to die: the camera. Despite the onslaught of camera phones — the iPhone 4 has this year become the most popular device for posting snaps to the photo-sharing website Flickr — cameras are still being sold. Japan, the world's largest manufacturer, shipped nearly three times as many cameras in January as it did in the same month of 2003, when the camera phone was still in its infancy. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 rose on Tuesday after strong earnings and upbeat outlooks from big manufacturers like 3M Co, but Apple's slide ahead of its results drove the Nasdaq down. Shares of Apple Inc, however, reversed course after the bell when the iPad maker reported quarterly revenue that handily beat Wall Street's estimates. Apple's stock jumped 6.9 percent to $599 in extended trading after closing at $560.28, down 2 percent. The stock of the world's most valuable company has fallen in recent weeks after its huge run higher. ...
