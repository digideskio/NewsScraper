Inflation in Latin America's No. 3 economy is already running at up to 25 percent per year, according to independent economists, one of the highest rates in the world. Prices for the emblematic beverage, which is served in a small-gourd-like cup, have skyrocketed in the last few weeks - partly due to a severe drought that hit crops in the main northern growing areas. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Deeper recessions, spiralling unemployment and a failure to meet budget deficit targets will afflict the euro zone's most vulnerable economies floundering under austerity, a Reuters poll suggested on Thursday.

     <title>Indonesia suspends some U.S. beef imports on mad cow</title>
     <description>
      JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia will suspend imports of some types of U.S. beef from Thursday because of a confirmed U.S. case of mad cow disease, Vice Agriculture Minister Rusman Heriawan told Reuters. Major buyers of U.S. beef have said they will continue with U.S. beef imports after a Californian dairy cow was found with the disease, so the partial ban from Indonesia will have little impact. Southeast Asia's largest economy only accounted for 0.6 percent of U.S. beef exports worth about $17 million in 2011, according to U.S. government figures. ...
