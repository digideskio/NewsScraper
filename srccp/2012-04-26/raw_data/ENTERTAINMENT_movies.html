And Tobey Maguire, our narrator in a boater hat, walks us through the story again. In Luhrmann's creative hands, &quot;Gatsby&quot; feels like something new. ...

Actress Anailin de la Rua de la Torre and actor Javier Nunez Florian, cast members of &quot;Una Noche&quot; (&quot;One Night&quot;), failed to appear at the Tribeca Film Festival debut on Thursday, prompting reports that the two may have defected -- a case of real life imitating art. ...

Earlier, the state-run newspaper al-Ahram incorrectly reported that the three-month sentence had been overturned on appeal. Imam's lawyers, Nabil Moawad and Safwat Hussein, told Reuters he remained a free man pending the outcome of an appeal against that conviction, the result of a case filed by the same plaintiff. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
