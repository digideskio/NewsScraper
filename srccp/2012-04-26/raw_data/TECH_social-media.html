     <title>Even Marines Can't Escape the Consequences of Facebook Rants</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | As social media has grown over the last several years, companies have had to create new policies and procedures regarding how to handle employees that misuse such outlets. It seems that even those serving in the military are not immune to the consequences, despite the fact that they are serving to protect our freedom. And, when a Marine sergeant tried to exercise his free speech via Facebook, he became an example of exactly what might happen when you take things too far.

     <description>

But how do the two shows compare when it comes to social media? Advertising Age recently teamed with social-media monitoring firm Trendrr in an effort to determine which show is creating the most buzz in the social-media world. And while the results aren't entirely conclusive (and quite possibly not entirely scientific), it appears that NBC's &quot;The Voice&quot; is coming out ahead. ...

      Former NBA star Steve Francis is &quot;used to the finer things&quot; and don't you forget it. An awesomely bad YouTube rap video took Twitter by storm Wednesday, bringing Francis briefly back into the public consciousness.

     <title>Marine Discharged For Criticizing Obama on Facebook</title>
     <description>
      His fate's been in limbo for nearly three weeks, but on Wednesday,&nbsp;Sgt. Gary Stein was discharged from the Marines without honor&nbsp;for making fun of the president on Facebook.&nbsp;It seems like it took the corps a long time to decide to go along with an April 6 recommendation by its administrative board, which said Stein should go. But then, his case is quite sensitive. The ACLU backed Stein's First Amendment right to criticize whoever he wants, but in the end it was the fact that he violated the oath he swore when he joined the Marines that did Stein in.

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has not been preparing for the IPO, but instead has been more focused on running the business and making acquisitions. As a result, the social networking giant’s IPO date will reportedly be pushed back so the company has time to make the appropriate preparations. Facebook&nbsp;filed with the SEC in February, and could raise as much as $10 billion at a $100 billion valuation when it goes public in the coming months. Facebook’s IPO is expected to top Google’s $1.9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has not been preparing for the IPO, but instead has been more focused on running the business and making acquisitions. As a result, the social networking giant’s IPO date will reportedly be pushed back so the company has time to make the appropriate preparations. Facebook&nbsp;filed with the SEC in February, and could raise as much as $10 billion at a $100 billion valuation when it goes public in the coming months. Facebook’s IPO is expected to top Google’s $1.9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Facebook Should Pay Attention to Netflix</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Facebook should probably take a hard look at the fate of Netflix stock. Granted the Internet giants have little in common on the surface, but as CNBC reports, the chief issue with Netflix's recent stock price drop has to do with expansion concerns. When it comes to expansion, Facebook is also facing similar questions leading up to what is likely to be a record setting IPO. Facebook has set a torrid pace for growth, but seems unable to keep up that pace.

      CNBC reports that Facebook's much-ballyhooed IPO may be pushed from May to June due to &quot;a string of acquisitions and other business distractions.&quot; We'll note the change on our calendars while Mark Zuckerberg presumably celebrates a few more weeks as a freewheelin' hacker king.

     <title>Even Marines Can't Escape the Consequences of Facebook Rants</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | As social media has grown over the last several years, companies have had to create new policies and procedures regarding how to handle employees that misuse such outlets. It seems that even those serving in the military are not immune to the consequences, despite the fact that they are serving to protect our freedom. And, when a Marine sergeant tried to exercise his free speech via Facebook, he became an example of exactly what might happen when you take things too far.

     <title>Close call in &quot;Idol&quot; and &quot;Voice&quot; social media race</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - &quot;The Voice&quot; has proven to be a formidable foe to the formerly untouchable &quot;American Idol&quot; on the ratings front. But how do the two shows compare when it comes to social media? Advertising Age recently teamed with social-media monitoring firm Trendrr in an effort to determine which show is creating the most buzz in the social-media world. And while the results aren't entirely conclusive (and quite possibly not entirely scientific), it appears that NBC's &quot;The Voice&quot; is coming out ahead. ...

     <title>Ex-NBA Star's Awesomely Bad YouTube Rap Brings Out the Twitter Haters [VIDEO]</title>
     <description>
      Former NBA star Steve Francis is &quot;used to the finer things&quot; and don't you forget it. An awesomely bad YouTube rap video took Twitter by storm Wednesday, bringing Francis briefly back into the public consciousness. Predictably however, most of the Twitter commentary was derisive (see gallery below).

     <title>Marine Discharged For Criticizing Obama on Facebook</title>
     <description>
      His fate's been in limbo for nearly three weeks, but on Wednesday,&nbsp;Sgt. Gary Stein was discharged from the Marines without honor&nbsp;for making fun of the president on Facebook.&nbsp;It seems like it took the corps a long time to decide to go along with an April 6 recommendation by its administrative board, which said Stein should go. But then, his case is quite sensitive. The ACLU backed Stein's First Amendment right to criticize whoever he wants, but in the end it was the fact that he violated the oath he swore when he joined the Marines that did Stein in.

The first round of reports surfaced in 2010, but was shot down when Facebook denied that it was working on its own smartphone with hardware and software partner HTC. The handsets that were thought to be Facebook phones ended up being unveiled the following month as the HTC Chacha and HTC Salsa, but consumers weren’t terribly interested in mid-range Android phones with a dedicated Facebook sharing button. Rumors resurfaced this past November before dissipating as quickly as they came, but now — whether or not consumers are actually interested in the possibility of a Facebook-branded smartphone —&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The first round of reports surfaced in 2010, but was shot down when Facebook denied that it was working on its own smartphone with hardware and software partner HTC. The handsets that were thought to be Facebook phones ended up being unveiled the following month as the HTC Chacha and HTC Salsa, but consumers weren’t terribly interested in mid-range Android phones with a dedicated Facebook sharing button. Rumors resurfaced this past November before dissipating as quickly as they came, but now — whether or not consumers are actually interested in the possibility of a Facebook-branded smartphone —&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has not been preparing for the IPO, but instead has been more focused on running the business and making acquisitions. As a result, the social networking giant’s IPO date will reportedly be pushed back so the company has time to make the appropriate preparations.

     <title>Facebook Should Pay Attention to Netflix</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Facebook should probably take a hard look at the fate of Netflix stock. Granted the Internet giants have little in common on the surface, but as CNBC reports, the chief issue with Netflix's recent stock price drop has to do with expansion concerns. When it comes to expansion, Facebook is also facing similar questions leading up to what is likely to be a record setting IPO. Facebook has set a torrid pace for growth, but seems unable to keep up that pace.
