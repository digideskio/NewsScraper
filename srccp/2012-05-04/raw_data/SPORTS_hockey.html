     <description>
      File-This Sept. 17, 2011 file photo shows New York Rangers coach John Tortorella speaking with the media at NHL hockey training camp in Tarrytown N.Y.

The irritable coach of the New York Rangers clearly disdains the ongoing media gatherings he is required to hold as his top-seeded club faces the Washington Capitals in an Eastern Conference semifinal series.

     <title>After long Game 3, Rangers, Caps head to Game 4</title>
     <description>
      File-This Sept. 17, 2011 file photo shows New York Rangers coach John Tortorella speaking with the media at NHL hockey training camp in Tarrytown N.Y. Tortorella's answers at pregame, postgame, and off-day news conferences are about as short as Alex Ovechkin's spins on the ice during the playoffs. The irritable coach of the New York Rangers clearly disdains the ongoing media gatherings he is required to hold as his top-seeded club faces the Washington Capitals in an Eastern Conference semifinal series.
