     <title>‘Loch Ness Monster’ ordered to leave Wisconsin river</title>
     <description>
      The Loch Ness Monster has finally surfaced—in Wisconsin's Chippewa River. And state officials want it to go. To be clear, the object in question is actually a sculpture meant to resemble &quot;Nessie,&quot; the mythological creature supposedly navigating a deep body of water in Scotland. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources spokesman Dan Baumann says the sculpture [...]

     <title>Mysterious origin of Solomon Islands’ dark-skinned blonds revealed</title>
     <description>
      Researchers have discovered a single gene that caused inhabitants of the Solomon Islands to have the unique combination of very dark skin and very blond hair. On Thursday, the journal Science reported that a single gene mutation is responsible for the unique pairing. Perhaps most interesting, the findings debunk theories that residents of the Solomon [...]

     <title>Court rejects appeal in wife's attempt to poison mistress</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - A microbiologist charged under an anti-terrorism law for attempting to poison her husband's mistress lost a bid to overturn her conviction on Thursday. Carol Anne Bond had argued that the U.S. federal chemical weapons act, which makes it a crime to acquire or use any chemical weapon, was meant to target terrorist activity, not the crimes of a spurned lover. A Philadelphia-based federal court rejected Bond's appeal, ruling that the government was justified in applying the law, even if it seemed a questionable move. ...

      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California university student left handcuffed in a federal holding cell for nearly five days without food or water has filed a claim for up to $20 million in compensation, saying he suffered kidney failure and nearly died as a result. The five-page notice, a precursor to a lawsuit against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act, was sent Wednesday to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration by a lawyer for the student, Daniel Chong, who has said he was forced to drink his own urine to stay alive. ...

     <title>Researcher believed killed by lab bacteria</title>
     <description>
      FAIRFAX, California (Reuters) - A young research associate killed by a highly virulent strain of meningococcal disease is believed to have contracted the bacteria from the San Francisco lab where he was working on a vaccine against it, public health officials said on Thursday. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention experts are seeking to confirm what they already suspect: that Richard Din, 25, died Saturday in an unusual case of a scientist being fatally infected with an agent from his own laboratory. ...

     <title>Snake blamed for Oklahoma City power outage</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - A snake that crawled into an electrical substation on Thursday knocked out power to nearly 14,000 homes on the northwest side of Oklahoma's state capital, utility officials said. The power failure occurred at about 2 a.m. (7 a.m. British time) when the snake touched a component that caused a switch to trip, Oklahoma Gas and Electric spokeswoman Karen Kurtz said, adding that the snake was evidently seeking shelter after heavy rains. At the scene of the crime, no one could determine exactly what kind of serpent caused all the trouble. ...

The spray, WA|HH Quantum Sensations, was created by David Edwards and was unveiled during a recent Paris exhibition. The short-term effects are reportedly due to the [...]

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - A man who impersonated his dead mother as part of a real estate scam - using lipstick, manicured nails and even an oxygen tank at a meeting - was convicted of fraud on Thursday and faces up to 83 years in prison, prosecutors said. Thomas Parkin, 51, was found guilty of 11 criminal counts, including charges of fraud, grand larceny, perjury and forgery for his scams. Along with the real estate fraud, Parkin and a partner cashed his mother's social security checks every month for six years, stealing about $44,000. ...

     <title>Oklahoma says running out of death penalty drug</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Oklahoma, which executes more prisoners per capita than any other state, said on Wednesday it has only one remaining dose of pentobarbital, a key drug used to kill condemned prisoners. One reason the state is running out is because of a ban on the sale of drugs for such purposes by the European Union, which opposes the death penalty. Oklahoma has a single vial of pentobarbital left after the execution on Tuesday night of 57-year-old Michael B. Selsor, prison spokesman Jerry Massie said. ...

     <title>Woman blames moths for fiery Colorado car crash</title>
     <description>
      DENVER (Reuters) - An 18-year-old Colorado woman who survived a fiery crash in her sport utility vehicle told authorities she lost control and struck a tree after being distracted by fluttering moths, police said on Wednesday. The woman, who was not identified by authorities, was driving her GMC Denali in Colorado Springs on Tuesday when she veered off the road and crashed, according to a police blotter entry. As gasoline poured from a ruptured fuel line, passing motorists pulled her out of the driver's side window before the car burst into flames. ...

To be clear, the object in question is actually a sculpture meant to resemble &quot;Nessie,&quot; the mythological creature supposedly navigating a deep body of water in Scotland. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources spokesman Dan Baumann says the sculpture [...]

     <title>Court rejects appeal in wife's attempt to poison mistress</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - A microbiologist charged under an anti-terrorism law for attempting to poison her husband's mistress lost a bid to overturn her conviction on Thursday. Carol Anne Bond had argued that the U.S. federal chemical weapons act, which makes it a crime to acquire or use any chemical weapon, was meant to target terrorist activity, not the crimes of a spurned lover. A Philadelphia-based federal court rejected Bond's appeal, ruling that the government was justified in applying the law, even if it seemed a questionable move. ...

      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California university student left handcuffed in a federal holding cell for nearly five days without food or water has filed a claim for up to $20 million in compensation, saying he suffered kidney failure and nearly died as a result. The five-page notice, a precursor to a lawsuit against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act, was sent Wednesday to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration by a lawyer for the student, Daniel Chong, who has said he was forced to drink his own urine to stay alive. ...

     <title>Researcher believed killed by lab bacteria</title>
     <description>
      FAIRFAX, California (Reuters) - A young research associate killed by a highly virulent strain of meningococcal disease is believed to have contracted the bacteria from the San Francisco lab where he was working on a vaccine against it, public health officials said on Thursday. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention experts are seeking to confirm what they already suspect: that Richard Din, 25, died Saturday in an unusual case of a scientist being fatally infected with an agent from his own laboratory. ...

     <title>Snake blamed for Oklahoma City power outage</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - A snake that crawled into an electrical substation on Thursday knocked out power to nearly 14,000 homes on the northwest side of Oklahoma's state capital, utility officials said. The power failure occurred at about 2 a.m. (7 a.m. British time) when the snake touched a component that caused a switch to trip, Oklahoma Gas and Electric spokeswoman Karen Kurtz said, adding that the snake was evidently seeking shelter after heavy rains. At the scene of the crime, no one could determine exactly what kind of serpent caused all the trouble. ...

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - A man who impersonated his dead mother as part of a real estate scam - using lipstick, manicured nails and even an oxygen tank at a meeting - was convicted of fraud on Thursday and faces up to 83 years in prison, prosecutors said. Thomas Parkin, 51, was found guilty of 11 criminal counts, including charges of fraud, grand larceny, perjury and forgery for his scams.

     <title>Oklahoma says running out of death penalty drug</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Oklahoma, which executes more prisoners per capita than any other state, said on Wednesday it has only one remaining dose of pentobarbital, a key drug used to kill condemned prisoners. One reason the state is running out is because of a ban on the sale of drugs for such purposes by the European Union, which opposes the death penalty. Oklahoma has a single vial of pentobarbital left after the execution on Tuesday night of 57-year-old Michael B. Selsor, prison spokesman Jerry Massie said. ...

The woman, who was not identified by authorities, was driving her GMC Denali in Colorado Springs on Tuesday when she veered off the road and crashed, according to a police blotter entry.
