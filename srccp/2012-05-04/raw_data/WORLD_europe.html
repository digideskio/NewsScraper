     <description>

     <title>Anti-EU party says PM faces &quot;political earthquake&quot;</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - The leader of Britain's biggest anti-European Union party said on Friday his best-ever local election result was the first tremor of a political earthquake that would tear out a crucial chunk of the ruling Conservative Party's electoral support. Nigel Farage, leader of the small UK Independence Party (UKIP) and known for his grandiloquent gestures, assumed a cool yet buoyant demeanour after local elections dealt a drubbing to David Cameron's Conservatives and rattled lawmakers eyeing 2015 national elections. Time, he felt, was on his side. ...

     <description>
      ABOARD HMS OCEAN, GREENWICH, England (Reuters) - Britain's biggest warship narrowly escaped a spot of trouble on Friday when it just scraped through a tight gap on the Thames river on its way to join a pre-Olympics exercise in London.

     <title>Anti-EU party says PM faces &quot;political earthquake&quot;</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - The leader of Britain's biggest anti-European Union party said on Friday his best-ever local election result was the first tremor of a political earthquake that would tear out a crucial chunk of the ruling Conservative Party's electoral support. Nigel Farage, leader of the small UK Independence Party (UKIP) and known for his grandiloquent gestures, assumed a cool yet buoyant demeanour after local elections dealt a drubbing to David Cameron's Conservatives and rattled lawmakers eyeing 2015 national elections. Time, he felt, was on his side. ...
