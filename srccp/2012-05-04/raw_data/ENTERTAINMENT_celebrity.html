At least in the Twitterverse. The &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; actress ended months of speculation Thursday, finally answering the question: &quot;When is she going to change her Twitter handle?&quot; Moore had been going by @MrsKutcher, a handle that grew more awkward with each passing day since November, when she announced plans to divorce &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; star Kutcher. Moore now goes by @JustDemi. According to her account, the actress chose the new moniker because it's &quot;playful. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Gossip blogger Hilton (real name: Mario Armando Lavandeira) has been slapped with a lawsuit after reporting that the man who designed Jolie's ring had previously been found guilty of fraud. Hilton's report, published April 17 on his Coco Perez offshoot site, claimed that jeweler Robert Procop, who designed the ring with Pitt, had previously been successfully sued for fraud by a customer named Roy Allenstein. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Yes, there is discussion of his music, the 40th anniversary world tour of the progressive rock classic &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, and of its 2012 follow up. But there is also a lot more about flutes in space, an unlikely link with the George W. Bush White House - and the importance of prostate examinations. Anderson, now 64 and dapper rather than the frenzied druid-cum-warlock of yore, is quite clear and animated about the latter. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Pinault, 49, who is currently married to actress Salma Hayek, denied that charge but testified he told Evangelista that &quot;if she were to have a child (they) might not have a relationship.&quot; With that a four-month relationship, in which he said the couple only actually saw each other seven days, came to an end. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Her children became only the second set of octuplets known to have survived birth in the United States. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

As the Leveson Inquiry on press ethics began to delve into the relationships between politicians and the media, with James Murdoch as a witness, the court heard that Jeremy Hunt, the culture minister, had had numerous secret contacts with James and his top London lobbyist. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

More than a dozen insiders in the ruling African National Congress told Reuters that Zuma had the race in hand even though there are strong factions in the party who want him out and could make things difficult. &quot;It's Zuma's race to lose,&quot; said one senior ANC member. The winner of December's party vote is almost certain to be its nominee in the 2014 presidential election. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>South Africa's apartheid land fix withers in fields</title>
     <description>
      SENEKAL, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africa's plans to undo the wrongs of apartheid by returning land seized from native blacks is embodied in the life of Koos Mthimkhulu. He was born on a white-owned farm in 1955 and attended a school set up by white farmers to give him just enough education for a life as field hand. A short childhood gave way to decades of milking cows, driving tractors and ploughing fields for poverty-level wages. When white-minority rule ended in 1994, the new democratic government made it a priority to return land to those dispossessed. ...

At least in the Twitterverse. The &quot;G.I.

Moore now goes by @JustDemi. According to her account, the actress chose the new moniker because it's &quot;playful. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

At least in the Twitterverse. The &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; actress ended months of speculation Thursday, finally answering the question: &quot;When is she going to change her Twitter handle?&quot; Moore had been going by @MrsKutcher, a handle that grew more awkward with each passing day since November, when she announced plans to divorce &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; star Kutcher.

But there is also a lot more about flutes in space, an unlikely link with the George W. Bush White House - and the importance of prostate examinations. Anderson, now 64 and dapper rather than the frenzied druid-cum-warlock of yore, is quite clear and animated about the latter. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian businessman Clive Palmer on Friday said he plans to build and operate a fleet of four freighters to import nickel ore to a nickel refining plant purchased from BHP Billiton. The decision by the billionaire, who made much of his fortune buying and selling coastal real estate, comes days after announcing he would build an &quot;unsinkable&quot; version of the Titanic to mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the original ocean liner. ...

Nadya Suleman, 36, gave birth to eight babies as a single mother in 2009. But goodwill turned to anger in the media after it was revealed Suleman had undergone fertility treatments when she already had six children, and questions were raised about her ability to provide for her family. Her children became only the second set of octuplets known to have survived birth in the United States. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Nadya Suleman, 36, gave birth to eight babies as a single mother in 2009. But goodwill turned to anger in the media after it was revealed Suleman had undergone fertility treatments when she already had six children, and questions were raised about her ability to provide for her family. Her children became only the second set of octuplets known to have survived birth in the United States. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Salahi, who plans to run as a Republican, stressed politics over publicity as his reason for taking action. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

More than a dozen insiders in the ruling African National Congress told Reuters that Zuma had the race in hand even though there are strong factions in the party who want him out and could make things difficult. &quot;It's Zuma's race to lose,&quot; said one senior ANC member.

     <description>
      SENEKAL, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africa's plans to undo the wrongs of apartheid by returning land seized from native blacks is embodied in the life of Koos Mthimkhulu.
