     <description>
      (Reuters) - A judge in Ohio on Friday sentenced former NFL quarterback Art Schlichter to more than 10 years in prison for a phony ticket scheme and granted his request to have his damaged brain donated to science after he dies. A court-ordered mental examination of Schlichter, 52, found damage to the frontal lobes of his brain, a likely result of some 15 concussions he suffered during a stellar career at Ohio State University and in high school, said his attorney, Steven Nolder. ...

To find out, researchers who study sports-related injuries are examining the brains of former National Football League players like Junior Seau, 43, who committed suicide on Wednesday. They are trying to determine what, if any, long-term effect sports-related head injuries can have on players and whether damage caused by repeated jarring blows could have contributed to Seau's and other players' deaths. ...

He wants to share his story whenever he can as a cautionary tale to NFL rookies and veterans alike--and people struggling with addictions.
