     <title>5 Expenses You Won't Have in Retirement</title>
     <description>
      Many retirement experts have determined that you are likely to need between 70 percent and over 100 percent of your current salary to finance your retirement years. But most people will never need close to their peak income once they stop working because there are some costs that you simply won't have any more in retirement. Here are a few expenses that you can reduce or eliminate in retirement:

     <title>How Boomers' Generosity Hurts Their Retirement</title>
     <description>
      In a poignant scene in HBO's Girls, the parents of a young twentysomething living in New York inform her that they will no longer be giving her money every month. She will need to get a job and learn how to support herself. Hannah, the twentysomething, protests. She later returns to her parents' hotel room to beg them to reconsider. Her mother refuses. She's worked hard, she tells her daughter, and as a college professor close to retirement, she deserves a comfortable retirement, along with the lake house she's always wanted.

     <title>U.S. Medicare to cover Edwards Sapien heart valve</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Medicare and Medicaid federal health insurance programs will cover the non-invasive Sapien heart valve replacement system from Edwards Lifesciences Corp, U.S. regulators said on Tuesday. The Sapien system, which is threaded to the diseased heart through an incision in the groin or ribs via the femoral artery, is meant for patients deemed too sick to have heart valve replacement using more traditional open-heart surgery. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the Sapien valve, which is estimated to cost about $30,000, in November. The U.S. ...

     <description>
      Motivating yourself to save for a retirement that's decades in the future can be a daunting challenge. Behavioral researchers are testing exactly what triggers cause people to sign up for retirement accounts and increase their contributions. It turns out that a variety of experiences, including spending time with your grandparents, worrying about problems you could face in old age, and even picturing what you will look like in retirement could pursuade you to boost your retirement account contributions. Here's what researchers say motivates us to save for retirement:

     <title>Why Employers Value Older Workers</title>
     <description>
      As the imminence of baby boomer retirements becomes more of a reality for employers, many have realized that the departures of some of their most experienced and competent employees will create big gaps. There has been no significant erosion of the traditional retirement age of 65. But there is evidence that many more employers will be developing programs to retain or even recruit older employees.

His distant successor as president of France, who will be elected on Sunday for five years, faces the same puzzle of how to reform a perennially rebellious nation to meet the economic challenges of the 21st century. Conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy set out with great energy in 2007 to shake things up but ran out of steam after loosening the 35-hour work week and raising the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 in the face of massive resistance. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      Many retirement experts have determined that you are likely to need between 70 percent and over 100 percent of your current salary to finance your retirement years. But most people will never need close to their peak income once they stop working because there are some costs that you simply won't have any more in retirement. Here are a few expenses that you can reduce or eliminate in retirement:

     <title>How Boomers' Generosity Hurts Their Retirement</title>
     <description>
      In a poignant scene in HBO's Girls, the parents of a young twentysomething living in New York inform her that they will no longer be giving her money every month. She will need to get a job and learn how to support herself. Hannah, the twentysomething, protests. She later returns to her parents' hotel room to beg them to reconsider. Her mother refuses. She's worked hard, she tells her daughter, and as a college professor close to retirement, she deserves a comfortable retirement, along with the lake house she's always wanted.

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Medicare and Medicaid federal health insurance programs will cover the non-invasive Sapien heart valve replacement system from Edwards Lifesciences Corp, U.S. regulators said on Tuesday. The Sapien system, which is threaded to the diseased heart through an incision in the groin or ribs via the femoral artery, is meant for patients deemed too sick to have heart valve replacement using more traditional open-heart surgery. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the Sapien valve, which is estimated to cost about $30,000, in November. The U.S. ...

Here's what researchers say motivates us to save for retirement:

     <title>Why Employers Value Older Workers</title>
     <description>
      As the imminence of baby boomer retirements becomes more of a reality for employers, many have realized that the departures of some of their most experienced and competent employees will create big gaps. There has been no significant erosion of the traditional retirement age of 65. But there is evidence that many more employers will be developing programs to retain or even recruit older employees.
