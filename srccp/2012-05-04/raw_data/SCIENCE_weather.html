     <description>
      In 2008, Obama campaigned on a pledge to enact a sweeping cap-and-trade law that would slash fossil-fuel pollution, mandate increased production of renewable electricity, and spend $150 billion on clean-energy research over a decade.

He used his executive authority to issue Environmental Protection Agency regulations to cut fossil-fuel emissions from power plants and to ramp up fuel-economy standards for vehicles. ...

Being one of three triplet means having to share things among three, which can make a person turn out a little funny, probably. This research has no implications for the personality of triplets. But, there is some good news for the well being of those born in threes. ...

Being one of three triplet means having to share things among three, which can make a person turn out a little funny, probably. This research has no implications for the personality of triplets.
