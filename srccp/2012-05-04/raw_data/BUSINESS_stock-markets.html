     <title>Global stocks, oil slump on weak jobs data</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks swooned and crude oil tumbled on Friday after a weak U.S. jobs report and data that suggested a deeper recession across the euro zone than previously thought dented sentiment. Major U.S. and European stock indexes fell more than 1 percent, U.S. crude oil slumped about 4 percent and government debt prices jumped after the Labor Department said American employers cut back on hiring in April more than expected. The week loomed as the worst this year for stocks on Wall Street, with energy leading the decline. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are seeing plenty of green this quarter, but they are raising red flags about the future. Earnings growth is running at nearly 8 percent for the first quarter, better than expected, but are issuing negative outlooks for the second quarter by a ratio of 3.3 to 1, the worst ratio since late 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. That ratio this week briefly rose to 3.9 to 1, the worst in more than a decade. It is a sign that executives are worried about the U.S. ...

     <description>
      (In May 3 item, corrects affiliation of trader in paragraph 5) NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as economic data sent mixed signals on the recovery a day before the April payrolls report, while shares of Green Mountain plunged after poor results. Slower-than-expected growth in the dominant U.S. services sector drove the day's trading. The retail sector dragged the market lower after several chains, including Target Corp and Gap Inc , fell after missing April sales estimates. Market expectations for Friday's non-farm payrolls report have fallen this week. ...

     <description>
      BOSTON (Reuters) - In the midst of the stock market's giant first quarter, the best since 1998, investors drove up share prices of money managers expecting booming results. But as the results came in, investors headed for the exits after discovering just how reliant money managers remained on out-of-favor stock funds. Starting on April 18 with BlackRock Inc , the biggest money manager, and running through May 2 with Franklin Resources Inc , investors were disappointed with underwhelming revenue and profit growth. ...

     <description>
      DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish airline Aer Lingus offered its first dividend in more than five years as a public company Friday following a return to profit, disappointing some shareholders who had hoped for a bigger payout.

     <title>Climate change ahead for seasonal investment flows</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Just this once, might it be wiser to 'buy in May'? Followers of the slightly tired but remarkably prescient old stock market adage &quot;Sell in May and stay away&quot; are justifiably confident that history is on their side. Then again, rules are there to be broken and there's just a hint of a change in seasonal investment climate this year. Going against what have become identified as negative seasonal money flows is never terribly attractive for investors and there are no shortage of potential pitfalls looming over the coming northern summer. ...

     <title>Miners drag FTSE lower ahead of US jobs data</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top shares fell on Friday, tracking weakness on Wall Street, ahead of the U.S. monthly employment report which follows a run of lacklustre economic data from the world's biggest economy. Mining stocks came under pressure, constituting six of the FTSE 100's top ten fallers, reflecting the negative implications of a slower U.S. economy on the demand outlook for metals. Antofagasta led blue chips lower again, down 3.2 percent, having issued a downbeat production update in the previous session, followed by Kazakhmys, off 2.7 percent, and Xstrata, 2.3 percent weaker. ...

Major U.S. and European stock indexes fell more than 1 percent, U.S. crude oil slumped about 4 percent and government debt prices jumped after the Labor Department said American employers reduced hiring more than expected in April. The week was the worst this year for Wall Street stocks, with energy leading the decline.

     <title>Global stocks, oil slump on weak jobs data</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks swooned and crude oil tumbled on Friday after a weak U.S. jobs report and data that suggested a deeper recession across the euro zone than previously thought dented sentiment. Major U.S. and European stock indexes fell more than 1 percent, U.S. crude oil slumped about 4 percent and government debt prices jumped after the Labor Department said American employers cut back on hiring in April more than expected. The week loomed as the worst this year for stocks on Wall Street, with energy leading the decline. ...

     <title>Analysis: Corporate outlooks cloud strong U.S. earnings</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are seeing plenty of green this quarter, but they are raising red flags about the future. Earnings growth is running at nearly 8 percent for the first quarter, better than expected, but are issuing negative outlooks for the second quarter by a ratio of 3.3 to 1, the worst ratio since late 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. That ratio this week briefly rose to 3.9 to 1, the worst in more than a decade. It is a sign that executives are worried about the U.S. ...

     <description>
      (In May 3 item, corrects affiliation of trader in paragraph 5) NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as economic data sent mixed signals on the recovery a day before the April payrolls report, while shares of Green Mountain plunged after poor results. Slower-than-expected growth in the dominant U.S. services sector drove the day's trading. The retail sector dragged the market lower after several chains, including Target Corp and Gap Inc , fell after missing April sales estimates. Market expectations for Friday's non-farm payrolls report have fallen this week. ...

     <description>
      BOSTON (Reuters) - In the midst of the stock market's giant first quarter, the best since 1998, investors drove up share prices of money managers expecting booming results. But as the results came in, investors headed for the exits after discovering just how reliant money managers remained on out-of-favor stock funds. Starting on April 18 with BlackRock Inc , the biggest money manager, and running through May 2 with Franklin Resources Inc , investors were disappointed with underwhelming revenue and profit growth. ...

     <description>
      DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish airline Aer Lingus offered its first dividend in more than five years as a public company Friday following a return to profit, disappointing some shareholders who had hoped for a bigger payout. Aer Lingus, which has not made any form of distribution to shareholders since its stock market listing in 2006, said on Friday it intends to declare an ordinary dividend of 3 cents per share, to be paid in July. This will make a total payout of approximately 15.9 million euros ($21 million) this year. ...

Followers of the slightly tired but remarkably prescient old stock market adage &quot;Sell in May and stay away&quot; are justifiably confident that history is on their side. Then again, rules are there to be broken and there's just a hint of a change in seasonal investment climate this year. Going against what have become identified as negative seasonal money flows is never terribly attractive for investors and there are no shortage of potential pitfalls looming over the coming northern summer. ...
