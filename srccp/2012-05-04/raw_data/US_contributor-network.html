     <title>Love Drinks With Fructose? Some Should Be Wary, Study Says</title>
     <description>
      Fans of fruit juices and sodas with fructose should be concerned about their choice of beverages, based on a new Duke University study. The North Carolina project considered the link between obese and diabetic individuals fond of fructose-loaded drinks and developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

     <title>Hey, Medicare Fraud Bums: They're Coming for You</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | My husband and I pay almost $900 a month for health insurance. Yeah, it frustrates us when we write that check. Health insurance is compulsory in Massachusetts. Complaining isn't going to change that. I cannot come to grips, though, with medical professionals bilking millions of dollars from Medicare.

     <title>Five Things President Obama and Mitt Romney Could Do for the American People</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | President Obama and Mitt Romney could do American voters a favor and take a break. Every day, Obama points his finger at Romney, every day Romney points his at Obama, while stuck in the middle are the American people. Both men say they want to lead the American people back to prosperity, to make America great again.

     <title>Predjudice and Discrimination in North Carolina's Amendment One Vote</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | North Carolina's controversial Amendment One vote is just under a week away. The amendment states that &quot;Marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state&quot; and is very discriminatory against homosexuals. Now comes even more news that shows the bigotry and hatred behind the proposed state constitutional amendment. A Baptist church pastor, Sean Harris, preached in a sermon on Sunday in Fayetteville, N.C., that if you see your son &quot;dropping the limp wrist, you walk over there and crack that wrist. ...

     <title>Republicans Simply Do Not Believe Women Paid Less Than Men</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Somewhere in all the political rhetoric and posturing, an inkling of what might be a fundamental truth might glimmer but never take hold in one's conscious mind. Sometimes, though, it bursts through like a runaway train. Such was undoubtedly the epiphany experienced by MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow when she discovered that the reason Republicans have no interest in fixing the wage gap between women and men or keeping in place -- or enacting -- laws to protect against gender payroll discrimination is due to the fact that most Republicans do not believe that such a gap exists.

     <title>Gingrich Calls it Quits on the Presidency, but Not His Fight</title>
     <description>
      Newt Gingrich officially pulled the plug on his campaign for the presidency on Wednesday, although he appeared to stop short of fully endorsing GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney as had been expected. Gingrich said that he and his wife Callista plan to continue to campaign for Republican leadership on all levels of government throughout the rest of the year, from local to federal.

     <title>Bachmann Endorses Romney Even Though He 'Cannot Beat Obama'</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Some will say Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., was exercising her female prerogative -- that of changing her mind. As sexist and condescending as that might sound (and is), there will be others who will simply count it as accepting the inevitable. But it might well be just a little short of hypocritical, given some of her past statements.

     <description>

     <title>Houston Family Locked in Restaurant Should Know Better</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY| Every now and then it seems like the mandatory gratuity charge on restaurant bills creeps into headlines. KPRC Houston is now reporting the fate of one recent dinning party that refused to pay a 17 percent mandatory gratuity due to lousy service. According to the report, restaurant staff locked the doors and called police. Of course, the report concludes that party paid the tip to avoid any future problems. Apparently some folks in the service industry have forgotten that once a charge is mandatory it becomes less generous.

     <title>Illinois Legislative Scholarship Program Nears End with Senate Vote</title>
     <description>
      According to the Chicago Sun-Times, in a 43-5 vote, the Illinois Senate approved a bill on Thursday that seeks to eliminate the legislative scholarship program. The program, which was established back in 1909, has been under fire for years due to several incidents of abuse and political favors. Additionally, more lawmakers, including high-profile politicians like Gov. Pat Quinn and Illinois Senate President John Cullerton, have continued to back the abolition of it.

     <title>Fate of Pennsylvania Casino License in Question</title>
     <description>
      Pennsylvania has the second highest gaming revenue in America, according to the Associated Press. The Keystone State managed to achieve that mark with just 11 of the legally allowed 14 casinos, but that number of allowed casinos could change to 13, as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. The paper highlights the 2004 law that permits Pennsylvania to have seven horse track casinos, five stand-alone casinos, and two resort type casinos. Two stand-alone casinos were supposed to build in the Philadelphia area, but now lawmakers are starting to waver on fifth gambling establishment in that area.

     <title>Hey, Medicare Fraud Bums: They're Coming for You</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | My husband and I pay almost $900 a month for health insurance. Yeah, it frustrates us when we write that check. Health insurance is compulsory in Massachusetts. Complaining isn't going to change that. I cannot come to grips, though, with medical professionals bilking millions of dollars from Medicare.

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | President Obama and Mitt Romney could do American voters a favor and take a break.

     <title>Predjudice and Discrimination in North Carolina's Amendment One Vote</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | North Carolina's controversial Amendment One vote is just under a week away. The amendment states that &quot;Marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state&quot; and is very discriminatory against homosexuals. Now comes even more news that shows the bigotry and hatred behind the proposed state constitutional amendment. A Baptist church pastor, Sean Harris, preached in a sermon on Sunday in Fayetteville, N.C., that if you see your son &quot;dropping the limp wrist, you walk over there and crack that wrist. ...

     <title>Republicans Simply Do Not Believe Women Paid Less Than Men</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Somewhere in all the political rhetoric and posturing, an inkling of what might be a fundamental truth might glimmer but never take hold in one's conscious mind. Sometimes, though, it bursts through like a runaway train. Such was undoubtedly the epiphany experienced by MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow when she discovered that the reason Republicans have no interest in fixing the wage gap between women and men or keeping in place -- or enacting -- laws to protect against gender payroll discrimination is due to the fact that most Republicans do not believe that such a gap exists.

     <title>Gingrich Calls it Quits on the Presidency, but Not His Fight</title>
     <description>
      Newt Gingrich officially pulled the plug on his campaign for the presidency on Wednesday, although he appeared to stop short of fully endorsing GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney as had been expected. Gingrich said that he and his wife Callista plan to continue to campaign for Republican leadership on all levels of government throughout the rest of the year, from local to federal.

     <title>Bachmann Endorses Romney Even Though He 'Cannot Beat Obama'</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Some will say Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., was exercising her female prerogative -- that of changing her mind. As sexist and condescending as that might sound (and is), there will be others who will simply count it as accepting the inevitable. But it might well be just a little short of hypocritical, given some of her past statements.

     <title>Republicans, Pundits Ridicule Obama's New Campaign Slogan</title>
     <description>
      The Obama campaign unveiled its slogan for the 2012 elections this week. The slogan is simple, just one-word will set the tone for the campaign. That word is &quot;Forward,&quot; and it is being mocked by the GOP. The ridicule is coming from Republican leaders, pundits, and even Mitt Romney himself. Here is a look at some of the things being said about the new campaign slogan.

     <title>Houston Family Locked in Restaurant Should Know Better</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY| Every now and then it seems like the mandatory gratuity charge on restaurant bills creeps into headlines. KPRC Houston is now reporting the fate of one recent dinning party that refused to pay a 17 percent mandatory gratuity due to lousy service. According to the report, restaurant staff locked the doors and called police. Of course, the report concludes that party paid the tip to avoid any future problems. Apparently some folks in the service industry have forgotten that once a charge is mandatory it becomes less generous.

     <title>Illinois Legislative Scholarship Program Nears End with Senate Vote</title>
     <description>
      According to the Chicago Sun-Times, in a 43-5 vote, the Illinois Senate approved a bill on Thursday that seeks to eliminate the legislative scholarship program. The program, which was established back in 1909, has been under fire for years due to several incidents of abuse and political favors. Additionally, more lawmakers, including high-profile politicians like Gov. Pat Quinn and Illinois Senate President John Cullerton, have continued to back the abolition of it.

      COMMENTARY | When Jasmine Marks and family went out to eat at the La Fisherman Restaurant on Highway 6 in west Houston, she felt the service wasn't satisfactory.

     <title>Fate of Pennsylvania Casino License in Question</title>
     <description>
      Pennsylvania has the second highest gaming revenue in America, according to the Associated Press. The Keystone State managed to achieve that mark with just 11 of the legally allowed 14 casinos, but that number of allowed casinos could change to 13, as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. The paper highlights the 2004 law that permits Pennsylvania to have seven horse track casinos, five stand-alone casinos, and two resort type casinos. Two stand-alone casinos were supposed to build in the Philadelphia area, but now lawmakers are starting to waver on fifth gambling establishment in that area.
