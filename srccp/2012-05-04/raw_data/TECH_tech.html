     <title>Facebook valued at up to $95B in IPO price range</title>
     <description>

A published report says Facebook is seeking a valuation of $85 billion to $95 billion when it goes public in a few weeks. The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, said Thursday May 3, 2012 that the company plans to set the per-share price of its stock in the high $20s to mid $30s. This is a narrower range than the previously expected $75 billion to $100 billion. Facebook's initial public offering will be by far the largest Internet IPO ever, dwarfing even Google Inc.'s in 2004.
