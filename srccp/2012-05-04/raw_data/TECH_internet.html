     <title>&quot;Hunger Games&quot; success spells trouble for TV ads</title>
     <description>
      BEVERLY HILLS (Reuters) - The success with which &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film harnessed social networks, en route to becoming 2012's biggest blockbuster, underscores a growing threat to billions of dollars in movie-advertising revenue on which broadcasters rely. The futuristic movie about children fighting to the death has scared up more than $375 million at the U.S. box office since it opened in March, in part because Lions Gate aggressively stoked interest on social network sites like Facebook and Twitter. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Bret Easton Ellis and Paul Schrader are tapping into the power of crowdsourcing for their upcoming joint project, &quot;The Canyons.&quot; The author-director team made their pitch to the masses via a Kickstarter campaign launched by the film's producer, Braxton Pope, on Thursday. Through their populist appeal, the trio makes a convincing play for movie buffs' lunch money by offering some big perks to would-be donors in hopes of pulling in $100,000 by June 9. ...

     <description>
      BEVERLY HILLS (Reuters) - The success with which &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film harnessed social networks, en route to becoming 2012's biggest blockbuster, underscores a growing threat to billions of dollars in movie-advertising revenue on which broadcasters rely.
