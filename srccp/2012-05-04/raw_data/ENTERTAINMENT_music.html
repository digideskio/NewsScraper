He was 47. Yauch, Mike Diamond and Adam Horovitz formed the band that gained fame in the 1980s and stood out not just for their music, but for their ethnicity. In a genre dominated by African-Americans, they were three white Jewish kids from Brooklyn, New York. The Beastie Boys sold some 40 million records worldwide over more than 20 years. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Jason Mraz eulogizes love in new album</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - After rocketing to international fame with his bubbly pop track &quot;I'm Yours&quot; in 2008, singer Jason Mraz strapped on his cowboy boots and added a country flair to his fourth album, &quot;Love Is A Four Letter Word.&quot; Mraz, 34, known for his laid-back folk-pop melodies, embraced a mantra of peaceful southern California beachside living for the record, which is currently in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 album chart. Mraz said his inspiration came from a piece of artwork, which features rectangles, circles, triangles and squares placed alongside each other to form the word ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - MTV and the Viacom Music Group are returning to the birthplace of rock 'n' roll for the third O Music Awards, staging a road trip from Memphis to New Orleans in which one band will break the Guinness World Record for &quot;Most Live Concerts&quot; in 24 hours. That record currently belongs to Jay-Z. The awards show, which honors music but with a focus on digital, will combine 24 hours of both awards and musical performances - all of it live.

Gotye has enjoyed a rapid rise in fame, not just in the U.S. but around the world, for the song of a failed relationship that features New Zealand artist Kimbra.

Yes, there is discussion of his music, the 40th anniversary world tour of the progressive rock classic &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, and of its 2012 follow up. But there is also a lot more about flutes in space, an unlikely link with the George W. Bush White House - and the importance of prostate examinations. Anderson, now 64 and dapper rather than the frenzied druid-cum-warlock of yore, is quite clear and animated about the latter. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Review: &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack comes up skimpy</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - There's an old adage that goes &quot;Leave ‘em wanting more,&quot; and although that may not be a specifically Broadway or TV adage, it's been adopted for the &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack album, which solves the problem of whether to fill the disc up with pop covers or musical-comedy originals by not offering enough of either.

     <title>Review: Underwood's &quot;Blown Away&quot; is a breeze</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It's a good thing that you can't judge a book by its sleeve art, because Carrie Underwood's fourth album, &quot;Blown Away,&quot; arrives this week bearing one of the tackiest country music album covers of all time - a ludicrously airbrushed portrait that dares you not to focus on Underwood's gleaming, Angelina-like right gam while the star gazes into the distance like a fembot on a romance-novel jacket. It's a relief to find the music inside is better... sometimes, much better. ...

     <title>Review: Harrison's &quot;Early Takes&quot; is beautifully bare</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Back in 2003, the surviving Beatles authorized the release of &quot;Let It Be... Naked,&quot; an album of remixes that stripped away the most outlandish production flourishes producer Phil Spector had added to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 1970. In a way, the new George Harrison release &quot;Early Takes, Volume 1&quot; does the same thing for the former Beatle's Spector-produced 1970 solo debut, &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; as, among other selections, it offers up six songs from that landmark effort in completely unvarnished form. ...

Yes, there is discussion of his music, the 40th anniversary world tour of the progressive rock classic &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, and of its 2012 follow up. But there is also a lot more about flutes in space, an unlikely link with the George W. Bush White House - and the importance of prostate examinations. Anderson, now 64 and dapper rather than the frenzied druid-cum-warlock of yore, is quite clear and animated about the latter. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - There's an old adage that goes &quot;Leave ‘em wanting more,&quot; and although that may not be a specifically Broadway or TV adage, it's been adopted for the &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack album, which solves the problem of whether to fill the disc up with pop covers or musical-comedy originals by not offering enough of either. Another five-letter S-word would seem to apply: s-k-i-m-p. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It's a good thing that you can't judge a book by its sleeve art, because Carrie Underwood's fourth album, &quot;Blown Away,&quot; arrives this week bearing one of the tackiest country music album covers of all time - a ludicrously airbrushed portrait that dares you not to focus on Underwood's gleaming, Angelina-like right gam while the star gazes into the distance like a fembot on a romance-novel jacket. It's a relief to find the music inside is better... sometimes, much better. ...
