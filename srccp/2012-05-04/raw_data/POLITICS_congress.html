     <title>Congressional Campus Politics</title>
     <description>
      Need-based student-loan interest rates are set to double on July 1 to 6.8 percent. If that happens, the loans will cost a little bit more for borrowers. If Congress stops the rate increase, the loans will cost a little bit more for taxpayers. A casual listener would never know that from the public debate. Student loans have become the rhetorical stump on which the Obama administration and Congress can argue about tangentially related political points.

     <title>Congress fights over future of export bank</title>
     <description>
      Since the Export-Import Bank was founded in 1934, Congress has methodically renewed its charter two-dozen times with little or no controversy, attesting to the independent federal agency's low-key, generally well-regarded mission of helping finance American companies' overseas sales.

     <title>Bachmann Endorses Romney Even Though He 'Cannot Beat Obama'</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Some will say Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., was exercising her female prerogative -- that of changing her mind.

But it might well be just a little short of hypocritical, given some of her past statements.

     <title>Congress fights over future of export bank</title>
     <description>
      Since the Export-Import Bank was founded in 1934, Congress has methodically renewed its charter two dozen times with little or no controversy, attesting to the independent federal agency's low-key, generally well-regarded mission of helping finance American companies' overseas sales.

     <title>Congressional Campus Politics</title>
     <description>
      Need-based student-loan interest rates are set to double on July 1 to 6.8 percent. If that happens, the loans will cost a little bit more for borrowers. If Congress stops the rate increase, the loans will cost a little bit more for taxpayers. A casual listener would never know that from the public debate. Student loans have become the rhetorical stump on which the Obama administration and Congress can argue about tangentially related political points.

The Chamber of Deputies voted 207-32 in favor of expropriating YPF, clearing the way for President Cristina Fernandez to sign the bill into law. The Senate last week approved the measure by a similarly overwhelming margin. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Bachmann Endorses Romney Even Though He 'Cannot Beat Obama'</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Some will say Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., was exercising her female prerogative -- that of changing her mind.

But it might well be just a little short of hypocritical, given some of her past statements.
