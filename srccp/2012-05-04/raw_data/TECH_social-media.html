Facebook on Thursday set an indicative IPO price range of $28 to $35 a share, which would value the world's largest online social network at $77 billion to $96 billion.

     <title>Facebook's Creepy, Mesmerizing Roadshow Video</title>
     <description>
      Just a few days before&nbsp;their IPO roadshow is set to kick off, Facebook has released&nbsp;a half-hour long video love letter&nbsp;to would-be investors.&nbsp;We're impressed with its overall look—it's got gentle lighting, soft focus, and lots of feigned sincerity—but we can't help noticing something a little disconcerting about the whole thing. All that gentle lighting, soft focus, and feigned sincerity, can't stop Facebook's leaders from sounding a little creepy.

Moore now goes by @JustDemi. According to her account, the actress chose the new moniker because it's &quot;playful. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Facebook IPO price range's midpoint $31.50: source</title>
     <description>
      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc plans to price its initial public offering at a range with a mid-point of $31.50 a share, a source familiar with the IPO told Reuters on Thursday. The source, who declined to be identified because the information has not been publicized, did not elaborate on other details. The world's largest social network is expected to raise as much as $10 billion this month in what would be Silicon Valley's largest-ever market debut. The company had been expected to release an updated IPO prospectus this week. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)

      (Reuters) - As Facebook Inc prepares to market its $10.6 billion initial public offering to U.S. fund managers next week, brokerage Wedbush Securities set a $44-per-share price target that implies a potential capital gain of about 40 percent for IPO investors. Facebook on Thursday set an indicative IPO price range of $28 to $35 a share, which would value the world's largest online social network at $77 billion to $96 billion.

     <title>Facebook's Creepy, Mesmerizing Roadshow Video</title>
     <description>
      Just a few days before&nbsp;their IPO roadshow is set to kick off, Facebook has released&nbsp;a half-hour long video love letter&nbsp;to would-be investors.&nbsp;We're impressed with its overall look—it's got gentle lighting, soft focus, and lots of feigned sincerity—but we can't help noticing something a little disconcerting about the whole thing. All that gentle lighting, soft focus, and feigned sincerity, can't stop Facebook's leaders from sounding a little creepy.

Moore now goes by @JustDemi. According to her account, the actress chose the new moniker because it's &quot;playful. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

This latest controversy revolves around him dressing up in &quot;brownface&quot; for Pop Chips, and, yes, it's as bad as it sounds. But beyond this immediate kerfuffle, we realize something. With flub after flub, does Kutcher still deserve the &quot;social media genius&quot; label thrust upon him? We dont think so.

A published report says Facebook is seeking a valuation of $85 billion to $95 billion when it goes public in a few weeks. The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, said Thursday May 3, 2012 that the company plans to set the per-share price of its stock in the high $20s to mid $30s. This is a narrower range than the previously expected $75 billion to $100 billion.

     <title>Facebook IPO price range's midpoint $31.50: source</title>
     <description>
      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc plans to price its initial public offering at a range with a mid-point of $31.50 a share, a source familiar with the IPO told Reuters on Thursday. The source, who declined to be identified because the information has not been publicized, did not elaborate on other details. The world's largest social network is expected to raise as much as $10 billion this month in what would be Silicon Valley's largest-ever market debut. The company had been expected to release an updated IPO prospectus this week. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
