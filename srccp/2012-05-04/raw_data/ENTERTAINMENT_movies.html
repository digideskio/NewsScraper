     <title>&quot;Hunger Games&quot; success spells trouble for TV ads</title>
     <description>
      BEVERLY HILLS (Reuters) - The success with which &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film harnessed social networks, en route to becoming 2012's biggest blockbuster, underscores a growing threat to billions of dollars in movie-advertising revenue on which broadcasters rely. The futuristic movie about children fighting to the death has scared up more than $375 million at the U.S. box office since it opened in March, in part because Lions Gate aggressively stoked interest on social network sites like Facebook and Twitter. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - The Weinstein Company has acquired U.S. and Latin American rights to Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut, &quot;Quartet,&quot; the studio said Friday. The comedy's cast list reads like a who's who of British thespians, with Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Tom Courtenay and Pauline Collins all featured prominently. The movie boasts a script by &quot;The Pianist&quot; screenwriter Ronald Harwood. It tells the story of Reggie (Courtenay), Wilf (Billy Connolly) and Cissy (Collins) who reside in Beecham House, a home for retired opera singers. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Bret Easton Ellis and Paul Schrader are tapping into the power of crowdsourcing for their upcoming joint project, &quot;The Canyons.&quot; The author-director team made their pitch to the masses via a Kickstarter campaign launched by the film's producer, Braxton Pope, on Thursday. Through their populist appeal, the trio makes a convincing play for movie buffs' lunch money by offering some big perks to would-be donors in hopes of pulling in $100,000 by June 9. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - The U.S. Senate could approve long-pending nominations for a pair of FCC vacancies as early as Monday, finally clearing the way for two former agency staffers to move into top regulatory slots, individuals with knowledge of the situation told TheWrap. But the Senate's approval assumes no additional efforts by GOP senators to block confirmation votes for the duo, Jessica Rosenworcel and Ajit Pai. &quot;The question is are there other Republican senators out there who, like Grassley, may be playing the hold game?&quot; an individual with knowledge of the situation told TheWrap. ...

Platt produced the critically acclaimed &quot;Drive&quot; and one of Broadway's biggest successes, &quot;Wicked.&quot; &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; started as a feature comedy about a florist's assistant who grows a plant with a particular taste for humans. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - In the first clip from the sci-fi/action sequel &quot;Men in Black 3,&quot; everything old is new again. While the trailer for the film centered on Will Smith and his reprisal of his role as Agent K, the initial snippet from the film, out May 25, offers a first glimpse of Josh Brolin as a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K. In the film - the first in the franchise since 2002 - Agent J travels back in time to the 1960, back in the early days of the Men in Black agency, to prevent an alien from killing off Agent K and altering the course of time. ...

Hollywood's summer season kicks off on Friday with the release of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and as with recent years, the four-month period is dominated by superheroes, sequels and franchise reboots featuring epic battles between good and evil. Sound like something audiences have seen before? It is, and for good reason in the minds of major studio executives. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - &quot;The Evil Dead,&quot; with its campy take on the horror genre, established Sam Raimi as a young director to watch when it hit theaters in 1981. Now, with several Spider-Mans and a track record as one of Hollywood's foremost hit-makers under his belt, Raimi is suing the producers of a planned sequel to the film that helped him make his name. Renaissance Pictures, the production company Raimi formed with &quot;Evil Dead&quot; producer Robert Tapert and star Bruce Campbell to make the film, is listed as a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed this week in U.S. ...

     <title>&quot;Hunger Games&quot; success spells trouble for TV ads</title>
     <description>
      BEVERLY HILLS (Reuters) - The success with which &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film harnessed social networks, en route to becoming 2012's biggest blockbuster, underscores a growing threat to billions of dollars in movie-advertising revenue on which broadcasters rely. The futuristic movie about children fighting to the death has scared up more than $375 million at the U.S. box office since it opened in March, in part because Lions Gate aggressively stoked interest on social network sites like Facebook and Twitter. ...

The movie boasts a script by &quot;The Pianist&quot; screenwriter Ronald Harwood. It tells the story of Reggie (Courtenay), Wilf (Billy Connolly) and Cissy (Collins) who reside in Beecham House, a home for retired opera singers. ...

Marc Platt is producing the remake of the Roger Corman cult classic - which has already been redone in 1986 by Frank Oz. Platt produced the critically acclaimed &quot;Drive&quot; and one of Broadway's biggest successes, &quot;Wicked.&quot; &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; started as a feature comedy about a florist's assistant who grows a plant with a particular taste for humans. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - In the first clip from the sci-fi/action sequel &quot;Men in Black 3,&quot; everything old is new again. While the trailer for the film centered on Will Smith and his reprisal of his role as Agent K, the initial snippet from the film, out May 25, offers a first glimpse of Josh Brolin as a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K. In the film - the first in the franchise since 2002 - Agent J travels back in time to the 1960, back in the early days of the Men in Black agency, to prevent an alien from killing off Agent K and altering the course of time. ...

Hollywood's summer season kicks off on Friday with the release of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and as with recent years, the four-month period is dominated by superheroes, sequels and franchise reboots featuring epic battles between good and evil. Sound like something audiences have seen before? It is, and for good reason in the minds of major studio executives. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
