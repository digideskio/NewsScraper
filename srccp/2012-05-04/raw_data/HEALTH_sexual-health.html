     <title>Should you use condoms in an exclusive relationship?</title>
     <description>
      Many have told me that once they have sex with someone they're dating, they consider themselves exclusive and they don't sleep with anyone else; if the other person doesn't agree, they move on. Part of the decision has to do with not using condoms. I can count the times on one hand that I've had sex without using a condom, but many others seem to prefer forgoing condoms entirely once they're in an exclusive relationship.

At least 91 people were arrested in Miami; Houston; Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and four other cities on a variety of charges: from submitting false billing for home healthcare, mental health services, HIV infusions and physical therapy to money laundering and receiving kickbacks. ...

     <title>Patients leaving hospital against advice fare worse</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Hospital patients who leave against medical advice may have an increased risk of being readmitted or dying within a month, a study at one New York medical center finds. In the U.S., about 500,000 hospital patients a year sign themselves out against medical advice. Studies have suggested that decision can be unwise: patients hospitalized for asthma, HIV or a heart attack, for example, have been found to have an increased risk of readmission when they leave contrary to doctors' recommendations. ...

     <title>HIV-positive man fights charge that saliva was deadly</title>
     <description>
      ALBANY, New York (Reuters) - A gay-rights group is urging New York state's high court to overturn the conviction of an HIV-positive man whose saliva was found to be a &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; in a biting case. David Plunkett was sentenced in 2007 to 10 years in prison for aggravated assault, a felony that requires the use of a &quot;dangerous instrument.&quot; Plunkett argued unsuccessfully the charge could not be sustained because HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva. The Court of Appeals, New York's top court, will hear Plunkett's case on Thursday. ...

      AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Lawyers for Planned Parenthood told a federal judge on Thursday that the healthcare of 40,000 women would be disrupted as soon as May 1 unless he blocks a new Texas rule that excludes the family planning organization's clinics from a state program. But lawyers for the state said Planned Parenthood's mission was contrary to a Texas Women's Health Program goal of reducing abortions. The program provides cancer screenings, birth control and other health services to more than 100,000 low-income women. U.S. ...

     <description>
      AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Planned Parenthood filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday seeking to stop enforcement of a new Texas rule that excludes the family planning organization from a program that provides cancer screenings, birth control and other health services to low-income women in the state. The lawsuit filed by a group of Planned Parenthood clinics that do not provide abortions says the rule is unconstitutional and that it will lead to tens of thousands of women being unable to get preventive healthcare from their chosen provider. ...

     <title>Should you use condoms in an exclusive relationship?</title>
     <description>
      Many have told me that once they have sex with someone they're dating, they consider themselves exclusive and they don't sleep with anyone else; if the other person doesn't agree, they move on. Part of the decision has to do with not using condoms. I can count the times on one hand that I've had sex without using a condom, but many others seem to prefer forgoing condoms entirely once they're in an exclusive relationship.

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities have charged 107 people, including doctors and nurses, for trying to defraud the federal Medicare healthcare program for the elderly and disabled of about $452 million, the biggest Medicare fraud sweep to date, the Obama administration said on Wednesday. At least 91 people were arrested in Miami; Houston; Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and four other cities on a variety of charges: from submitting false billing for home healthcare, mental health services, HIV infusions and physical therapy to money laundering and receiving kickbacks. ...

     <title>Patients leaving hospital against advice fare worse</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Hospital patients who leave against medical advice may have an increased risk of being readmitted or dying within a month, a study at one New York medical center finds. In the U.S., about 500,000 hospital patients a year sign themselves out against medical advice. Studies have suggested that decision can be unwise: patients hospitalized for asthma, HIV or a heart attack, for example, have been found to have an increased risk of readmission when they leave contrary to doctors' recommendations. ...

      ALBANY, New York (Reuters) - A gay-rights group is urging New York state's high court to overturn the conviction of an HIV-positive man whose saliva was found to be a &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; in a biting case. David Plunkett was sentenced in 2007 to 10 years in prison for aggravated assault, a felony that requires the use of a &quot;dangerous instrument.&quot; Plunkett argued unsuccessfully the charge could not be sustained because HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva. The Court of Appeals, New York's top court, will hear Plunkett's case on Thursday. ...
