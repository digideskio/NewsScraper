It was the third straight month in which hiring had slowed, intensifying fears the U.S. recovery is losing momentum.

The company also benefited from much higher gains in its derivatives portfolio, offset in part by a substantial write-down on one of its bond holdings. The results come one day before the conglomerate's annual shareholder meeting, a festival-like event dubbed the &quot;Woodstock for Capitalism&quot; that draws nearly 40,000 investors to Omaha. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (Reuters) - Even after an embarrassing failure of the company's initial public offering on its listing system in March, business at BATS Global Markets is still going strong, a company executive said. In March, a series of blunders hit the market debut of BATS Global Markets Exchange Inc , causing its shares to erroneously trade for less than a penny. The problems also fouled a trade in shares of Apple Inc . BATS later took the extremely rare step of withdrawing its initial public offering of shares. ...

Nearly 40,000 Berkshire shareholders are gathering in Omaha this weekend for the company's annual meeting. While a good bit of Saturday's Q-and-A is expected to focus on Buffett's health and succession planning, the &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot; will inevitably field a number of questions on the economy. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are seeing plenty of green this quarter, but they are raising red flags about the future. Earnings growth is running at nearly 8 percent for the first quarter, better than expected, but are issuing negative outlooks for the second quarter by a ratio of 3.3 to 1, the worst ratio since late 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. That ratio this week briefly rose to 3.9 to 1, the worst in more than a decade. It is a sign that executives are worried about the U.S. ...

Employers added 115,000 workers to payrolls last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. It was the third straight month in which hiring had slowed, intensifying fears the U.S. recovery is losing momentum. Even a slight drop in the unemployment rate to 8.1 percent had a dark tone because the fall was due entirely to people dropping out of the workforce. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The company also benefited from much higher gains in its derivatives portfolio, offset in part by a substantial write-down on one of its bond holdings. The results come one day before the conglomerate's annual shareholder meeting, a festival-like event dubbed the &quot;Woodstock for Capitalism&quot; that draws nearly 40,000 investors to Omaha. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The firm issued the notification letters under federal and state laws that require employers to notify workers of mass layoffs in advance, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

     <description>
      NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (Reuters) - Even after an embarrassing failure of the company's initial public offering on its listing system in March, business at BATS Global Markets is still going strong, a company executive said. In March, a series of blunders hit the market debut of BATS Global Markets Exchange Inc , causing its shares to erroneously trade for less than a penny.

But officials with the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which sued current and former Wal-Mart executives on Thursday, stopped short of calling for CEO Mike Duke to step down. &quot;The leadership question is on the table,&quot; Jack Ehnes, CEO of CalSTRS, said when asked Friday whether Duke, a defendant in the lawsuit, should step down. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Commodity chemicals maker Westlake Chemical Corp said it has withdrawn its $1.9 billion offer to acquire Georgia Gulf Corp , following talks with its smaller peer's management. Shares of Georgia Gulf fell 9 percent to $31.30 in post-market trade on Friday. Westlake also said it plans to liquidate its holdings of Georgia Gulf common stock as market conditions permit. The company, in February, had threatened to withdraw its sweetened $1.9 billion offer, or $35 a share, for Georgia Gulf. ...

      (Reuters) - Opponents of corporate political donations plan to picket 3M Co's shareholder meeting on Tuesday in a bid to get the diversified U.S. manufacturer to stop making political contributions. About 100 protesters are expected to turn out at the meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota, to support a shareholder proposal that would prohibit the maker of Post-It notes and films used in television screens from directly contributing to election campaigns, according to organizers. ...

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are seeing plenty of green this quarter, but they are raising red flags about the future. Earnings growth is running at nearly 8 percent for the first quarter, better than expected, but are issuing negative outlooks for the second quarter by a ratio of 3.3 to 1, the worst ratio since late 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. That ratio this week briefly rose to 3.9 to 1, the worst in more than a decade. It is a sign that executives are worried about the U.S. ...
