     <title>Kids on cow farms may have fewer allergies</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Kids who grow up on farms and have contact with cows and cow milk are less likely to have allergies and asthma than kids raised nearby but not on a farm, according to a new study from Europe. Researchers had previously noticed that kids raised on European farms have lower rates of asthma and allergies than other children (see Reuters Health story of June 1, 2010). But the new findings help identify, at least in part, what specifically may protect some farm-raised youngsters against developing asthma or allergies. &quot;Nature can really teach us something here,&quot; said Dr. ...

     <title>Bird flu paper that raised bioterrorism fears published</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - The journal Nature has published the first of two controversial papers about laboratory-enhanced versions of the deadly bird flu virus that initially sparked fears among U.S. biosecurity experts that it could be used as a recipe for a bioterrorism weapon. The publication of the paper by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, on Wednesday follows months of acrimonious debate that pitted the need for science to be free of censorship against the obligation to protect the public from a potentially devastating flu pandemic. ...

     <title>CORRECTED: Fund fighting killer diseases cuts jobs, to focus on 20 countries</title>
     <description>
      GENEVA (Reuters) - The Global Fund, an organization that has received millions of dollars from Bill Gates but found grant money was being misused, is cutting its workforce and tightening its focus on 20 countries hardest hit by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The Global Fund's General Manager Gabriel Jaramillo said in a statement that the fund had completed a re-organization that would rebalance its workforce with 39 percent more people managing grants and 38 percent fewer in support roles. ...

     <title>Amish farm kids remarkably immune to allergies: study</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Amish children raised on rural farms in northern Indiana suffer from asthma and allergies less often even than Swiss farm kids, a group known to be relatively free from allergies, according to a new study. &quot;The rates are very, very low,&quot; said Dr. Mark Holbreich, the study's lead author. &quot;So there's something that we feel is even more protective in the Amish&quot; than in European farming communities. What it is about growing up on farms -- and Amish farms in particular -- that seems to prevent allergies remains unclear. ...

Kaitz thought a small growth under his left nipple was just a harmless cyst. By the time he had it checked out in 2006, almost two years later, the lump had started to hurt. The diagnosis was a shock. &quot;I had no idea in the world that men could even get breast cancer,&quot; Kaitz said. Now Kaitz does frequent self-exams and has mammograms every year. The American Cancer Society estimates 1 in 1,000 men will get breast cancer, versus 1 in 8 women. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Men rarely get breast cancer, but those who do often don't survive as long as women, largely because they don't even realize they can get it and are slow to recognize the warning signs, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug goes before an advisory panel next week, a potential blockbuster medicine that would revive faith in the company's research if its benefits are deemed to outweigh its side effects. Most industry analysts expect the Food and Drug Administration's expert committee to recommend approval despite risks posed by higher-than-normal cholesterol and liver enzyme levels and infections for patients taking tofacitinib during clinical trials. ...

     <title>Kids on cow farms may have fewer allergies</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Kids who grow up on farms and have contact with cows and cow milk are less likely to have allergies and asthma than kids raised nearby but not on a farm, according to a new study from Europe. Researchers had previously noticed that kids raised on European farms have lower rates of asthma and allergies than other children (see Reuters Health story of June 1, 2010). But the new findings help identify, at least in part, what specifically may protect some farm-raised youngsters against developing asthma or allergies. &quot;Nature can really teach us something here,&quot; said Dr. ...

      CHICAGO (Reuters) - The journal Nature has published the first of two controversial papers about laboratory-enhanced versions of the deadly bird flu virus that initially sparked fears among U.S. biosecurity experts that it could be used as a recipe for a bioterrorism weapon. The publication of the paper by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, on Wednesday follows months of acrimonious debate that pitted the need for science to be free of censorship against the obligation to protect the public from a potentially devastating flu pandemic. ...
