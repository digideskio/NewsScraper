Limbaugh responded to reports of lower CNN ratings by saying on his show that Cooper may be spending too much time in bars, restaurants and the gym. &quot;I swear. That guy is reported more in gossip columns to be at the gym, or that bar, or restaurant, than he is at the studio,&quot; Limbaugh said. Said Cooper on his CNN show Thursday: &quot;I don't know if you noticed, but he spoke for quite a while there and didn't call me a slut even one time. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Entrants also need to be open-minded about which category to enter, and even the genre. ...

      TUNIS (Reuters) - A Tunisian court on Thursday fined a television boss 2,400 dinars ($1,550) for showing the award winning film &quot;Persepolis&quot; after a trial that deepened a growing divide between Islamists and secularists. The court found Nabil Karoui, head of the Nessma private television station, guilty of disturbing public order and attacking moral values by broadcasting the animated film. The French/American film, about a girl growing up in Iran, includes a scene depicting Allah, which is forbidden in Islam. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - There's only one hard-and-fast rule of Emmy submissions: Set your ego aside. That might sound counterintuitive in a process that's about rewarding rich and famous people for doing their jobs exceptionally well. But as Emmy contenders submit their best work this week, those who have been through the process told TheWrap, again and again, that flexibility is key. Not just about which episode to submit. Entrants also need to be open-minded about which category to enter, and even the genre. ...

      TUNIS (Reuters) - A Tunisian court on Thursday fined a television boss 2,400 dinars ($1,550) for showing the award winning film &quot;Persepolis&quot; after a trial that deepened a growing divide between Islamists and secularists. The court found Nabil Karoui, head of the Nessma private television station, guilty of disturbing public order and attacking moral values by broadcasting the animated film. The French/American film, about a girl growing up in Iran, includes a scene depicting Allah, which is forbidden in Islam. ...
