In its Thursday ruling, the appeals court said the contract at the heart of the dealers' class-action suit was &quot;ambiguous.&quot; It also said evidence submitted by Ford was wrongly excluded. &quot;We hold that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Ford's mitigating evidence at the damages trial,&quot; the court said in its ruling. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The 14-year-old son of a Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was charged with murder on Friday after prosecutors said he used his father's service gun to shoot him in the head. The boy, whose name was not released because of his age, fired a single round through a window from outside the family home on Wednesday in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson, the local District Attorney's Office said in a statement.

The 280-pound (128 kg) bear, which was tagged and relocated to the mountains about 50 miles from the city of Boulder last week, was killed on Thursday morning, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill said. Last week, the three-year-old bear was spotted in a tree outside a student housing complex at the University of Colorado. ...

     <title>Planned Parenthood can be in Texas health program, court says</title>
     <description>
      AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Planned Parenthood can participate for now in a Texas health program for low-income women despite a new state rule that bans affiliates of abortion providers, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Friday. The court order from the 5th U.S. Circuit -- which lifts an emergency halt that was put in place on earlier this week -- is the latest in a series of alternating victories for Planned Parenthood and Texas. But the court battle is not over. ...

The group hopes representatives who are concerned about the planned closures of post offices or mail processing sites under the Postal Service's own cost-cutting plan will join them in pressing House leadership to hold a vote on the Senate bill. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Californian jailed 5 days without water seeks $20 million</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California university student left handcuffed in a federal holding cell for nearly five days without food or water has filed a claim for up to $20 million in compensation, saying he suffered kidney failure and nearly died as a result. The five-page notice, a precursor to a lawsuit against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act, was sent Wednesday to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration by a lawyer for the student, Daniel Chong, who has said he was forced to drink his own urine to stay alive. ...

     <title>Court rejects appeal in wife's attempt to poison mistress</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - A microbiologist charged under an anti-terrorism law for attempting to poison her husband's mistress lost a bid to overturn her conviction on Thursday. Carol Anne Bond had argued that the U.S. federal chemical weapons act, which makes it a crime to acquire or use any chemical weapon, was meant to target terrorist activity, not the crimes of a spurned lover. A Philadelphia-based federal court rejected Bond's appeal, ruling that the government was justified in applying the law, even if it seemed a questionable move. ...

Jason Weinstein, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's criminal division, argued that requirements for warrants at early stages of investigations would &quot;cripple&quot; prosecutors and law enforcement.

      (Reuters) - The Alabama State Senate on Thursday approved a bill allowing cash-strapped Jefferson County to revive a local jobs tax that county officials say is central to working out its $4.27 billion bankruptcy case. The bill, which must also be approved by the legislature's lower house and the governor, would allow any county in Alabama seeking relief from creditors under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to levy and collect taxes. The bill is worth about $60 million a year to Jefferson County and passed in Montgomery with a vote of 16 to 11, with one senator abstaining. ...

      KANSAS CITY, Missouri (Reuters) - A Kansas City woman who converted from Christianity to Islam has been awarded $5 million in punitive damages by a jury who found the telecommunications giant AT&amp;T created a &quot;hostile work environment&quot; after her conversion, according to a judge's order issued Friday. Susann Bashir, a 41-year-old married mother, sued AT&amp;T unit Southwestern Bell for what she said was a pattern of offensive and discriminatory conduct by her supervisors that began when she converted to Islam in 2005, six years after she started working for the company as a network technician. ...

      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The 14-year-old son of a Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was charged with murder on Friday after prosecutors said he used his father's service gun to shoot him in the head. The boy, whose name was not released because of his age, fired a single round through a window from outside the family home on Wednesday in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson, the local District Attorney's Office said in a statement.

In its Thursday ruling, the appeals court said the contract at the heart of the dealers' class-action suit was &quot;ambiguous.&quot; It also said evidence submitted by Ford was wrongly excluded. &quot;We hold that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Ford's mitigating evidence at the damages trial,&quot; the court said in its ruling. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California university student left handcuffed in a federal holding cell for nearly five days without food or water has filed a claim for up to $20 million in compensation, saying he suffered kidney failure and nearly died as a result. The five-page notice, a precursor to a lawsuit against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act, was sent Wednesday to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration by a lawyer for the student, Daniel Chong, who has said he was forced to drink his own urine to stay alive. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - A microbiologist charged under an anti-terrorism law for attempting to poison her husband's mistress lost a bid to overturn her conviction on Thursday. Carol Anne Bond had argued that the U.S. federal chemical weapons act, which makes it a crime to acquire or use any chemical weapon, was meant to target terrorist activity, not the crimes of a spurned lover. A Philadelphia-based federal court rejected Bond's appeal, ruling that the government was justified in applying the law, even if it seemed a questionable move. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress should pass a law to give investigators freer access to certain cellphone records, an Obama administration official said on Thursday, in remarks that raised concern among advocates of civil liberties and privacy. Jason Weinstein, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's criminal division, argued that requirements for warrants at early stages of investigations would &quot;cripple&quot; prosecutors and law enforcement.

Industry sources said the Interior Department could propose a new rule on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as early as Friday. The measure would require natural gas drillers to disclose chemicals they use to frack wells, a controversial process that involves injecting water, sand and chemicals deep underground to extract fuel from rock formations. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Industry sources said the Interior Department could propose a new rule on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as early as Friday. The measure would require natural gas drillers to disclose chemicals they use to frack wells, a controversial process that involves injecting water, sand and chemicals deep underground to extract fuel from rock formations. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Alabama Senate passes tax for bankrupt county</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - The Alabama State Senate on Thursday approved a bill allowing cash-strapped Jefferson County to revive a local jobs tax that county officials say is central to working out its $4.27 billion bankruptcy case. The bill, which must also be approved by the legislature's lower house and the governor, would allow any county in Alabama seeking relief from creditors under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to levy and collect taxes. The bill is worth about $60 million a year to Jefferson County and passed in Montgomery with a vote of 16 to 11, with one senator abstaining. ...

     <title>Son charged in killing of immigration and customs agent</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The 14-year-old son of a Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was charged with murder on Friday after prosecutors said he used his father's service gun to shoot him in the head. The boy, whose name was not released because of his age, fired a single round through a window from outside the family home on Wednesday in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson, the local District Attorney's Office said in a statement. Prosecutors declined to discuss a motive. ...

It was the third straight month in which hiring had slowed, intensifying fears the U.S. recovery is losing momentum.

     <title>Famous &quot;falling bear&quot; killed in Colorado car crash</title>
     <description>
      DENVER (Reuters) - A black bear made famous by an Internet photo of it falling from a tree after being tranquilized was struck by two cars and killed on a highway in Colorado this week, authorities said on Friday.

Last week, the three-year-old bear was spotted in a tree outside a student housing complex at the University of Colorado. ...

     <description>
      AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Planned Parenthood can participate for now in a Texas health program for low-income women despite a new state rule that bans affiliates of abortion providers, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Friday. The court order from the 5th U.S. Circuit -- which lifts an emergency halt that was put in place on earlier this week -- is the latest in a series of alternating victories for Planned Parenthood and Texas. But the court battle is not over. ...
