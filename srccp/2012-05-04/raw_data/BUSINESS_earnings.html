     <title>Analysis: Corporate outlooks cloud strong U.S. earnings</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are seeing plenty of green this quarter, but they are raising red flags about the future. Earnings growth is running at nearly 8 percent for the first quarter, better than expected, but are issuing negative outlooks for the second quarter by a ratio of 3.3 to 1, the worst ratio since late 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. That ratio this week briefly rose to 3.9 to 1, the worst in more than a decade. It is a sign that executives are worried about the U.S. ...

      (Reuters) - IGM Financial , one of Canada's largest mutual fund companies, said on Friday its quarterly earnings fell along with assets under management and sales.

      LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top shares fell early on Friday ahead of U.S. jobs data and a potentially tumultuous weekend for European politics, which sees elections in France and Greece, while banks weakened after results from BNP Paribas. FTSEurofirst 300 was down 5.27 points, or 0.5 percent at 1,039.12 by 0705 GMT.

      BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's highest court overturned an injunction that had suspended collection of disputed tax claims from Vale SA , the world's largest iron-ore producer, the company said on Thursday, adding it would appeal the ruling. The miner is fighting four tax bills issued by the federal tax authority, totaling 30.5 billion reals ($15.83 billion) on its earnings abroad.

     <title>European shares retreat ahead of elections, US payrolls</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top shares fell early on Friday ahead of U.S. jobs data and a potentially tumultuous weekend for European politics, which sees elections in France and Greece, while banks weakened after results from BNP Paribas. FTSEurofirst 300 was down 5.27 points, or 0.5 percent at 1,039.12 by 0705 GMT.

     <title>Brazil government wins appeal in tax dispute with Vale</title>
     <description>
      BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's highest court overturned an injunction that had suspended collection of disputed tax claims from Vale SA , the world's largest iron-ore producer, the company said on Thursday, adding it would appeal the ruling. The miner is fighting four tax bills issued by the federal tax authority, totaling 30.5 billion reals ($15.83 billion) on its earnings abroad.

      (Reuters) - Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc is normally a turbulent stock to trade after earnings but few were expecting the stock to lose nearly half its value in a day. The company's disappointing quarterly results burned traders as the shares plunged 48 percent and was egg on the face of analysts who maintained 'buy' ratings despite the stock's troubles even before this report. &quot;Technically the stock has suffered huge damage with the gap lower,&quot; said Gareth Feighery, a founder of options education firm MarketTamer.com. ...
