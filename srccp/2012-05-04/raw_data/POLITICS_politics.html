They are trying to determine what, if any, long-term effect sports-related head injuries can have on players and whether damage caused by repeated jarring blows could have contributed to Seau's and other players' deaths. ...

Even a slight drop in the unemployment rate to 8.1 percent had a dark tone because the fall was due entirely to people dropping out of the workforce. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - When 300-pound professional football players repeatedly slam into each other like runaway freight trains, what impact does that have on their brains?

They are trying to determine what, if any, long-term effect sports-related head injuries can have on players and whether damage caused by repeated jarring blows could have contributed to Seau's and other players' deaths. ...

Ferguson, who holds the title Duchess of York as the ex-wife of Britain's Prince Andrew, was not present in court. She signaled when the charges were brought in January that she would not return to face trial. The offences carry a maximum sentence of up to 22 years and six months. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Employers added 115,000 workers to payrolls last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. It was the third straight month in which hiring had slowed, intensifying fears the U.S. recovery is losing momentum. Even a slight drop in the unemployment rate to 8.1 percent had a dark tone because the fall was due entirely to people dropping out of the workforce. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Interior's proposal would update its decades-old fracking regulations with new reporting standards and a requirement that companies get approval before using the drilling technique. The proposal also would require companies to reveal chemicals they use in hydraulic fracturing after they complete the process. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
