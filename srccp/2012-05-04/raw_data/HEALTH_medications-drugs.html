     <title>Fewer jobs means more spending on U.S. Medicaid</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Millions of people turned to the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor during the 2007-2009 recession as families coped with job losses and drastic drops in income, pushing Medicaid spending up by an average of 6.6 percent per year, according to a study released on Friday. The study by the nonprofit Kaiser Foundation found that state and federal spending on the program, which states administer with partial reimbursements from the U.S. government, grew to $400 billion in 2010 from $330 billion in 2007. That represents an average annual increase of 6. ...

     <title>Some support for quit-smoking alternatives</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Acupuncture and hypnosis are touted as drug-free ways to help smokers kick the habit, and there is some evidence that they work, according to a new research review. There are still plenty of questions -- including exactly how effective the alternative therapies might be, and how they measure up against standard quit tactics. But researchers say the alternatives should stand as options for smokers who want them. The findings, reported in the American Journal of Medicine, come from a review of 14 previous clinical trials. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug goes before an advisory panel next week, a potential blockbuster medicine that would revive faith in the company's research if its benefits are deemed to outweigh its side effects. Most industry analysts expect the Food and Drug Administration's expert committee to recommend approval despite risks posed by higher-than-normal cholesterol and liver enzyme levels and infections for patients taking tofacitinib during clinical trials. ...

      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California university student left handcuffed in a federal holding cell for nearly five days without food or water has filed a claim for up to $20 million in compensation, saying he suffered kidney failure and nearly died as a result.

     <title>FDA says number of new drug shortages down</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Health officials said the number of new shortages of crucial drugs used to treat cancer and other illnesses had been halved compared to a year ago, and attributed the improvement to earlier notice from drugmakers about looming supply issues. There have been 42 newly scarce drugs so far this year, compared to 90 in the same period a year ago, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said on Thursday on the agency's website. Efforts to combat shortages escalated last year when 250 medicines were in short supply, up from 56 in 2006. ...

     <title>Fewer jobs means more spending on U.S. Medicaid</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Millions of people turned to the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor during the 2007-2009 recession as families coped with job losses and drastic drops in income, pushing Medicaid spending up by an average of 6.6 percent per year, according to a study released on Friday. The study by the nonprofit Kaiser Foundation found that state and federal spending on the program, which states administer with partial reimbursements from the U.S. government, grew to $400 billion in 2010 from $330 billion in 2007. That represents an average annual increase of 6. ...

     <title>Some support for quit-smoking alternatives</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Acupuncture and hypnosis are touted as drug-free ways to help smokers kick the habit, and there is some evidence that they work, according to a new research review. There are still plenty of questions -- including exactly how effective the alternative therapies might be, and how they measure up against standard quit tactics. But researchers say the alternatives should stand as options for smokers who want them. The findings, reported in the American Journal of Medicine, come from a review of 14 previous clinical trials. ...

Most industry analysts expect the Food and Drug Administration's expert committee to recommend approval despite risks posed by higher-than-normal cholesterol and liver enzyme levels and infections for patients taking tofacitinib during clinical trials. ...

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Health officials said the number of new shortages of crucial drugs used to treat cancer and other illnesses had been halved compared to a year ago, and attributed the improvement to earlier notice from drugmakers about looming supply issues. There have been 42 newly scarce drugs so far this year, compared to 90 in the same period a year ago, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said on Thursday on the agency's website. Efforts to combat shortages escalated last year when 250 medicines were in short supply, up from 56 in 2006. ...
