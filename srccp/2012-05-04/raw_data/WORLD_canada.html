     <title>Small gain seen in Canadian jobs in April</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Canada will be fortunate if it registered much of an employment increase in April after March's outsized gain of 82,300 jobs. Data out on May 11 is forecast to show a much smaller 7,000 gain, and the unemployment rate edging back up a tick to 7.3 percent, after having fallen in March to 7.2 percent from 7.4 percent. The consensus of 2 3 economists surveyed by Reuters is that March's surge [ID:nSCL5FE87O] was a one-off gain, with several predicting a reactive fall and none of the rest seeing employment rising at that rate for a second month. ...

     <title>Canada pipeline delays won't stop China investment</title>
     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Delays in building pipelines to carry oil from the oil sands of Alberta to Canada's West Coast for shipment to Asia should not squelch a boom in investments in the country's energy resources by Chinese companies, China's ambassador to Canada said on Friday. Spending by Chinese state-owned enterprises in Canadian oil sands and shale gas companies and projects has hit roughly C$20 billion ($20.1 billion), with the first priorities to learn about the business and show a profit, Zhang Junsai told reporters after speaking to a conference on Chinese investment in Canada. ...

     <description>
      DEER LODGE, Montana (Reuters) - The sole Canadian on death row in the United States asked Montana's parole board for clemency on Wednesday, saying he was a changed man who felt &quot;horrendously sorry&quot; for murdering two young men 30 years ago on an Indian reservation. Ronald Smith's plea came during a hearing that marked the first time the 54-year-old convicted killer, who once said he committed the murders in a drunken, drug-fueled rage because he &quot;wanted to know what it felt like,&quot; heard directly from relatives of his victims. ...

Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said a charitable donation would be an apt last stop for the pennies, which Canada is pulling from circulation later this year after 104 years. &quot;We hope all Canadians will consider putting their last pennies to good use by donating them to charity,&quot; Flaherty said. &quot;I consider it fitting they could have a lasting impact on causes that Canadians believe in. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Canada pipeline delays won't stop China investment</title>
     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Delays in building pipelines to carry oil from the oil sands of Alberta to Canada's West Coast for shipment to Asia should not squelch a boom in investments in the country's energy resources by Chinese companies, China's ambassador to Canada said on Friday. Spending by Chinese state-owned enterprises in Canadian oil sands and shale gas companies and projects has hit roughly C$20 billion ($20.1 billion), with the first priorities to learn about the business and show a profit, Zhang Junsai told reporters after speaking to a conference on Chinese investment in Canada. ...

      NEW YORK, N.Y. - In World War II's final moments in Europe, Associated Press correspondent Edward Kennedy gave his news agency perhaps the biggest scoop in its history.

Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said a charitable donation would be an apt last stop for the pennies, which Canada is pulling from circulation later this year after 104 years. &quot;We hope all Canadians will consider putting their last pennies to good use by donating them to charity,&quot; Flaherty said. &quot;I consider it fitting they could have a lasting impact on causes that Canadians believe in. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Small gain seen in Canadian jobs in April</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Canada will be fortunate if it registered much of an employment increase in April after March's outsized gain of 82,300 jobs. Data out on May 11 is forecast to show a much smaller 7,000 gain, and the unemployment rate edging back up a tick to 7.3 percent, after having fallen in March to 7.2 percent from 7.4 percent. The consensus of 2 3 economists surveyed by Reuters is that March's surge [ID:nSCL5FE87O] was a one-off gain, with several predicting a reactive fall and none of the rest seeing employment rising at that rate for a second month. ...

     <title>Canada pipeline delays won't stop China investment</title>
     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Delays in building pipelines to carry oil from the oil sands of Alberta to Canada's West Coast for shipment to Asia should not squelch a boom in investments in the country's energy resources by Chinese companies, China's ambassador to Canada said on Friday. Spending by Chinese state-owned enterprises in Canadian oil sands and shale gas companies and projects has hit roughly C$20 billion ($20.1 billion), with the first priorities to learn about the business and show a profit, Zhang Junsai told reporters after speaking to a conference on Chinese investment in Canada. ...

     <description>
      DEER LODGE, Montana (Reuters) - The sole Canadian on death row in the United States asked Montana's parole board for clemency on Wednesday, saying he was a changed man who felt &quot;horrendously sorry&quot; for murdering two young men 30 years ago on an Indian reservation. Ronald Smith's plea came during a hearing that marked the first time the 54-year-old convicted killer, who once said he committed the murders in a drunken, drug-fueled rage because he &quot;wanted to know what it felt like,&quot; heard directly from relatives of his victims. ...

Markets faltered after data showed tepid growth in the U.S. services sector. Stocks turned lower, government debt pared losses and the U.S. dollar trimmed gains against the yen after the Institute for Supply Management said its services sector index fell to 53.5 in April from 56.0 in March. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Markets faltered after data showed tepid growth in the U.S. services sector. Stocks turned lower, government debt pared losses and the U.S. dollar trimmed gains against the yen after the Institute for Supply Management said its services sector index fell to 53.5 in April from 56.0 in March. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Spending by Chinese state-owned enterprises in Canadian oil sands and shale gas companies and projects has hit roughly C$20 billion ($20.1 billion), with the first priorities to learn about the business and show a profit, Zhang Junsai told reporters after speaking to a conference on Chinese investment in Canada. ...

The Competition Bureau decision removes one of two major regulatory obstacles to one of the biggest deals in years in the agricultural sector. Swiss-based Glencore said in a press release that it received a letter on Thursday from the bureau, which operates independently of the government, saying it would not oppose the takeover. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
