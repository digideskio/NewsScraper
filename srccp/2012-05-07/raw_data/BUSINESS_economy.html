      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday as European election results revived worries the euro zone debt crisis may spread, reinforcing anxiety about anemic economic growth and petroleum demand fueled by last week's U.S. employment data showing slower job creation.

Trading was choppy and Brent and U.S. ...

The total number of vehicle miles driven in the U.S. peaked in November 2007 at some 3.03 trillion miles, just one month before the official beginning of the Great Recession. Since then, miles driven has leveled off to post-recession low of 2. ...
