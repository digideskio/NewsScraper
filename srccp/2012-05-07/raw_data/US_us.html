     <title>Court reverses itself on veterans healthcare overhaul</title>
     <description>

An 11-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said it lacked authority to direct changes to speed treatment of veterans. It also said it lacked authority to consider challenges to how the department adjudicates claims. ...

The cuts to food stamps, child tax credits and Medicaid healthcare for the poor, among others, are certain to stall in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But they stake out Republicans' negotiating stance on replacing $1.2 trillion in automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that are due to take effect in January. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The cuts to food stamps, child tax credits and Medicaid healthcare for the poor, among others, are certain to stall in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But they stake out Republicans' negotiating stance on replacing $1.2 trillion in automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that are due to take effect in January. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Javier Antonio Calle, for whom the U.S. government was offering a $5-million reward, turned himself in to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) on the Caribbean island of Aruba and was flown to New York on Friday, authorities said. &quot;As a result of ... ...

Two years later, when Nabors' portrayal of Gomer Pyle became so popular that a spin-off program was created, Lindsey was cast as Gomer's cousin Goober Pyle. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The boy was killed on Saturday night at an apartment where his 11-year-old sister and his grandparents were also present, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police spokesman Kendale Adams said in a statement. Police did not identify the girl because she is a juvenile. Authorities did not release any additional details about the case. ...

     <description>
      HARTFORD, Connecticut (Reuters) - The Connecticut Senate passed a bill on Saturday legalizing marijuana use for medical purposes with tight restrictions aimed at avoiding problems that have plagued some of the 16 other states where pot is now legal. After nearly 10 hours of debate, the Senate voted 21-13 in favor of the measure, which already cleared the House. Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy was expected to sign the bill. Once he does, Connecticut will join 16 other states and the District of Columbia in allowing use of marijuana to treat sick patients. ...

Same-sex marriage is illegal in North Carolina. But the state has stood out as the only one in the Southeast that has not passed a constitutional amendment solidifying such a ban. ...

A Rand Corporation study, published in the May issue of the journal Health Affairs, said so-called &quot;consumer-directed&quot; health plans would cut healthcare costs for the nonelderly by 4 percent, or $57 billion a year, if they accounted for half of all employer-sponsored health insurance. ...

      (Reuters) - A federal appeals court has reversed a ruling that ordered a major overhaul of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs because of the agency's failure to properly treat combat-related mental problems. An 11-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said it lacked authority to direct changes to speed treatment of veterans. It also said it lacked authority to consider challenges to how the department adjudicates claims. ...

Duncan was asked on MSNBC's &quot;Morning Joe&quot; program if he believes same-sex couples should legally be allowed to wed. &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; he said.

     <description>

It also said it lacked authority to consider challenges to how the department adjudicates claims. ...

     <title>Consumer-directed health plans show mixed results</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Employer-sponsored health insurance plans with low premiums and high deductibles could cut healthcare costs significantly but not without potential risks for workers, according to a study published on Monday. A Rand Corporation study, published in the May issue of the journal Health Affairs, said so-called &quot;consumer-directed&quot; health plans would cut healthcare costs for the nonelderly by 4 percent, or $57 billion a year, if they accounted for half of all employer-sponsored health insurance. ...

      BOGOTA (Reuters) - A Colombian suspected of running a violent cocaine cartel, one of the country's most-wanted men, has surrendered to U.S. drug officials and could get a lighter sentence if he helps authorities fight drug trafficking, Colombian police said on Monday. Javier Antonio Calle, for whom the U.S. government was offering a $5-million reward, turned himself in to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) on the Caribbean island of Aruba and was flown to New York on Friday, authorities said. &quot;As a result of ... ...

Two years later, when Nabors' portrayal of Gomer Pyle became so popular that a spin-off program was created, Lindsey was cast as Gomer's cousin Goober Pyle. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

But owners of the iconic edifice, planning a $1 billion initial public offering, hope to convince investors and tenants that it's what's on the inside that really counts. The 81-year-old New York tower has undergone a massive, 3-year makeover designed to cut energy use, modernize office suites, and attract tenants willing to shoulder higher rents. Building owners and key suppliers on Monday will detail the energy savings they've achieved so far. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The boy was killed on Saturday night at an apartment where his 11-year-old sister and his grandparents were also present, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police spokesman Kendale Adams said in a statement. Police did not identify the girl because she is a juvenile. Authorities did not release any additional details about the case. ...

     <description>
      HARTFORD, Connecticut (Reuters) - The Connecticut Senate passed a bill on Saturday legalizing marijuana use for medical purposes with tight restrictions aimed at avoiding problems that have plagued some of the 16 other states where pot is now legal. After nearly 10 hours of debate, the Senate voted 21-13 in favor of the measure, which already cleared the House. Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy was expected to sign the bill. Once he does, Connecticut will join 16 other states and the District of Columbia in allowing use of marijuana to treat sick patients. ...

In its Thursday ruling, the appeals court said the contract at the heart of the dealers' class-action suit was &quot;ambiguous.&quot; It also said evidence submitted by Ford was wrongly excluded. &quot;We hold that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Ford's mitigating evidence at the damages trial,&quot; the court said in its ruling. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An outbreak of a rare strain of salmonella poisoning linked to dog food has infected at least 14 people in nine states, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention said. Diamond Pet Foods produced the dry dog food at a South Carolina plant. The company voluntarily recalled three dry dog food products last month, the CDC said in a statement on Thursday. Infections were reported from October 8, 2011, to April 22, and five people were hospitalized. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Employer-sponsored health insurance plans with low premiums and high deductibles could cut healthcare costs significantly but not without potential risks for workers, according to a study published on Monday. A Rand Corporation study, published in the May issue of the journal Health Affairs, said so-called &quot;consumer-directed&quot; health plans would cut healthcare costs for the nonelderly by 4 percent, or $57 billion a year, if they accounted for half of all employer-sponsored health insurance. ...

     <title>Court reverses itself on veterans healthcare overhaul</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - A federal appeals court has reversed a ruling that ordered a major overhaul of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs because of the agency's failure to properly treat combat-related mental problems. An 11-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said it lacked authority to direct changes to speed treatment of veterans. It also said it lacked authority to consider challenges to how the department adjudicates claims. ...
