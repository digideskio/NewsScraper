     <title>'Brogramming' Not a Worrisome Trend, Indicates Prejudice Against Geeks</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to CNN, the tech industry is being scrutinized over the alleged rise of the &quot;brogrammer,&quot; a party animal, red-blooded masculine male who mixes his computer savvy with a love of juvenile womanizing and immature shenanigans.

     <description>
      Vice President Joe Biden appeared to say on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on Sunday that he fully supports gay marriage.

     <title>Ron Paul's Stubbornness Might Hurt GOP Against Obama</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Despite being a very distant second, I have to give it to Ron Paul. He's as stubborn as a mule and in a great deal of life that would benefit him. But if he is any shred of a company guy in terms of what the Republicans' goals are, that stubbornness will get Barack Obama re-elected.

      MOORESBORO, N.C. -- Will North Carolina join the rest of the Southern states in adding a marriage amendment to the state constitution?

(See a recent poll by the conservative Civitas Institute.) We talked to voters in North Carolina about their views a day ahead of Tuesday's vote. Here's a sampling.

     <title>Octomom's Financial Woes Are Not Her Only Problems</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to the Associated Press, Nadya Suleman -- aka Octomom -- is on the verge of losing her home and owes up to $1 million in debts. She has 14 children, three of whom have disabilities that require government support and eight of which are all the same age. While it's evident Suleman needs some serious support, I think her financial woes are the least of her concerns.

      COMMENTARY | According to ABC News, a Colorado first grader was recently suspended from school for singing the lyrics from the LMFAO son, &quot;I'm sexy and I know it.&quot; In spite of the fact the child has already been disciplined for singing the same song to the same girl, suspending him from school for sexual harassment is an overreaction.

     <title>Responsibility for Olympic Park Security Breach Falls on U.K. Government</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | A worker at London's Olympic Park was able to show flaws in security by smuggling a fake bomb into the complex, according to The Sun. At first glance, it would appear the worst part of this nightmare will be suffered by the security detail. As a political consultant, I see the greater part of this keeping the highest members of government in the U.K. up at night.

     <title>Why 'New' Occupy Movement Will Stay a Historical Footnote</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Members of the Occupy Movement hope to change the perceptions about the group, according to an extensive report by Spiegel Online via ABC News. The plan is to make the movement more peaceful, more organized and more focused. As a political scientist, I see the Occupy Movement as ultimately being a footnote in history because some of the most important changes that need to be made are not being looked at.

     <title>Breaking These Unwritten Rules Gets Occupy Protesters in Police Trouble</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | These unwritten rules aren't on the books, and were never voted into law. But Occupy protesters nationwide -- people who protest banks' and large corporations' influence on lawmaking and society, inspired by Occupy Wall Street -- are still getting in trouble with the police for breaking them. And while recent incidents underscore the dangers, these have been a problem for Occupy since the movement started and one is an even bigger potential problem for people outside it.

     <title>Westboro Baptist Church Elder and Spokesman Talks Gays, God and Obama</title>
     <description>
      The presidential election, along with discussion of economics and international policy, will highlight also religious faith and its impact on social and civic issues. One of the most intensely faithful religious bodies in the United States is the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), which may be among the most extreme examples of Biblical literalism in the country.

     <title>Octomom's Financial Woes Are Not Her Only Problems</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to the Associated Press, Nadya Suleman -- aka Octomom -- is on the verge of losing her home and owes up to $1 million in debts. She has 14 children, three of whom have disabilities that require government support and eight of which are all the same age. While it's evident Suleman needs some serious support, I think her financial woes are the least of her concerns.

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Until or unless Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion remains a legal medical procedure in this country. According to Reuters, that fact didn't stop Arizona Gov.

     <title>School Wrong to Suspend Singing First Grader</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to ABC News, a Colorado first grader was recently suspended from school for singing the lyrics from the LMFAO son, &quot;I'm sexy and I know it.&quot; In spite of the fact the child has already been disciplined for singing the same song to the same girl, suspending him from school for sexual harassment is an overreaction.

     <title>Busy Week for Michele Bachmann</title>
     <description>
      Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., had a busy week of endorsing and speaking. From May 3 to May 6, Bachmann was a whirlwind of activity from standing beside Mitt Romney to being interviewed by Bob Schieffer on CBS.

     <title>Responsibility for Olympic Park Security Breach Falls on U.K. Government</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | A worker at London's Olympic Park was able to show flaws in security by smuggling a fake bomb into the complex, according to The Sun. At first glance, it would appear the worst part of this nightmare will be suffered by the security detail. As a political consultant, I see the greater part of this keeping the highest members of government in the U.K. up at night.

     <title>Why 'New' Occupy Movement Will Stay a Historical Footnote</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Members of the Occupy Movement hope to change the perceptions about the group, according to an extensive report by Spiegel Online via ABC News. The plan is to make the movement more peaceful, more organized and more focused. As a political scientist, I see the Occupy Movement as ultimately being a footnote in history because some of the most important changes that need to be made are not being looked at.

     <title>Breaking These Unwritten Rules Gets Occupy Protesters in Police Trouble</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | These unwritten rules aren't on the books, and were never voted into law. But Occupy protesters nationwide -- people who protest banks' and large corporations' influence on lawmaking and society, inspired by Occupy Wall Street -- are still getting in trouble with the police for breaking them. And while recent incidents underscore the dangers, these have been a problem for Occupy since the movement started and one is an even bigger potential problem for people outside it.
