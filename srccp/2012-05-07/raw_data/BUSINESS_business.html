South Sudan inherited three-quarters of oil production when it gained independence from the North last July. But the pipelines are in Sudan and the two have been unable to agree on how much the South should pay to transport its oil, with the row escalating into a low-level armed conflict in recent weeks. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The company, which has operations in Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and offshore West Africa, said the well was drilled to a depth of 30,300 feet at a cost of about C$120 million ($120.7 million). The Kakuna well is on Green Canyon block 504 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where Nexen has so far discovered more than 500 million barrels of resources in the Appomattox area. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

South Sudan inherited three-quarters of oil production when it gained independence from the North last July. But the pipelines are in Sudan and the two have been unable to agree on how much the South should pay to transport its oil, with the row escalating into a low-level armed conflict in recent weeks. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
