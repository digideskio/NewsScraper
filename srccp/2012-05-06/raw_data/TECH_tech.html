     <title>Can Viddy beat Instagram?</title>
     <description>
      The hunt for the next big app never ceases. Everyone on the high seas of the tech world is an unquenchable Captain Ahab looking for the next Moby Dick. Except, when they actually find their white whale and spear it, they immediately want to find another one. The hot new pick to be the next big app looks to be the video-sharing service Viddy thanks to its Instagram-like features and famous new user. But will it really blow up as much as investors who are hoping for an $800 million app hope it will?

     <title>&quot;Liking&quot; Something on Facebook Not Protected by First Amendment</title>
     <description>
      It should go without saying that you should be careful of what you &quot;like&quot; on Facebook. You should try not to &quot;like&quot; anything embarrassing or incriminating, lest it come back to bite you. A judge has ruled that &quot;liking&quot; something on Facebook doesn't protect you under the First Amendment, which is bad news for at least one man in Virginia.&nbsp;

     <title>Samsung Galaxy S III official, hits international stores late May</title>
     <description>
      The rumors have been realized as Samsung unveiled the latest in its popular Galaxy line on Thursday. The S III is set to begin shipping in late May, pushing out a new wave of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich handsets. Launching with far less fanfare this week is the updated version of the mid-sized Panasonic Android tablet for mobile workers. And as far as rumored devices go, Sony may be catching up to rivals with an updated Xperia offering.

     <title>How to Learn to Stop Worrying and Love the Gmail Redesign</title>
     <description>
      After five months of agonizingly slow turnover, the old Gmail is dead. Since the switch was announced, screams from the Twitterian plebes were impossible to escape. &quot;Ugggh, today is THE WORST. Gmail is making me switch to the new design,&quot; is what their complaints would sound like, maybe adding a :( for emphasis. Everyone is on a level playing field now. We're all in the same, miserable boat.
