     <title>Mariano Rivera tears ACL during freak injury in batting practice</title>
     <description>
      The New York Yankees will go on without all-time saves leader Mariano Rivera, who twisted his right knee in a freak injury during batting practice Thursday, tearing his ACL and meniscus. Rivera, who is 42 years old and hadn't been on the disabled list in nine years, likely will miss the rest of the season because of the recovery time involved — usually 6-9 months. He hinted in spring training that he would retire after the season and, as of now, he doesn't know if he will pitch again. Rivera was teary talking to reporters.
