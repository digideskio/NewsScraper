     <title>Primary Piffle in North Carolina</title>
     <description>
      In the final week of a hotly fought Republican primary in North Carolina, one congressional candidate accuses his rival — in a&nbsp;mailer sent to GOP voters — of being a “Big Money Donor” to Democrats. And he accuses another of breaking a tax pledge. But we find both claims by … &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://factcheck.org/2012/05/primary-piffle-in-north-carolina/&quot;&gt;More &gt;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

     <title>For a 2012 Obama win, hip-hop stars must 'Barack the vote' like they did in 2008</title>
     <description>
      The hip-hop community stood in a loyal b-boy stance behind President Obama in 2008. Sean “Diddy” Combs encouraged young voters to “Vote or Die,” Jay-Z endorsed Mr. Obama on tour, and others rallied the urban community and millennial voters to jump on the “change” bandwagon.

     <title>Fuel for the Fire</title>
     <description>
      The price of oil is inexorably on the ascent. Projections show that the coming years will bring spikes in oil and gasoline costs that will strain household budgets and kneecap economic growth. Also on the rise are fossil-fuel emissions, spewed daily from cars, power plants, and factories—all of which scientists say are leading to a warming planet, rising sea levels, increased flooding, longer droughts, and stronger, more-devastating storms.

     <title>Defeating the Political Attack Ad</title>
     <description>
      “Negative Doesn’t Work: I’m Turning the Damn Channel.” That phrase, well, let’s just say I’m hoping it becomes one of the most remembered slogans from the 2012 election.

     <title>Dispatches from Afghanistan: An Introduction</title>
     <description>
      Only days after President Obama’s historic visit, National Journal Chief Correspondent Michael Hirsh travels to Afghanistan ahead of the NATO Summit in May to give readers an in-depth and exclusive assessment of America’s planned exit from the longest war in its history. The president, in his May 1 speech from Kabul, declared confidently both that the United States will successfully hand over Afghanistan to the Afghans by 2014, and he is winding down the war against al Qaeda begun on 9/11. “The goal that I set – to defeat al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild – is within reach,” Obama ...
