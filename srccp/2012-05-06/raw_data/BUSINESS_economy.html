The central bank has spent heavily to support Egypt's currency through the political turmoil since Hosni Mubarak's overthrow in February 2011, which prompted foreign investors to scurry for the exit and hammered tourism. Foreign reserves - which stood at $36 billion in December 2010 and fell every month since the uprising began - edged up to $15. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

At stake in the first general election since Greece detonated a wider European crisis at the end of 2009 is whether it will stick to the terms of a deeply unpopular EU/IMF bailout or start down a path that could take it out of the euro. Leaders from all sides emphasized the importance of the vote for the future of Greece, which is suffering one of Europe's worst postwar recessions. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

In less than three years, his PASOK party went from a landslide election victory to fifth place in opinion polls, loathed by Greeks for imposing crippling austerity measures and accused by European powers of mishandling a debt crisis that shook the euro zone to its foundations. ...

     <description>
      FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Thomas Cook Group Plc gained a three-year funding lifeline worth 1.4 billion pounds on Saturday, giving the world's oldest travel group more time to turn around its recession-scarred business. The 170-year-old firm warned about its profits three times last year as civil unrest in North Africa and the economic downturn in Britain hurt bookings, and it has been forced to consider a number of fundraising proposals. ...
