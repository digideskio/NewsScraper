Wal-Mart is one of Berkshire's largest common stock holdings. As of December 31, Berkshire's 39.04 million share stake in the retailer was worth about $2.33 billion. ...

     <title>Analysis: Corporate outlooks cloud strong U.S. earnings</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are seeing plenty of green this quarter, but they are raising red flags about the future.

      LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top shares fell early on Friday ahead of U.S. jobs data and a potentially tumultuous weekend for European politics, which sees elections in France and Greece, while banks weakened after results from BNP Paribas. FTSEurofirst 300 was down 5.27 points, or 0.5 percent at 1,039.12 by 0705 GMT.
