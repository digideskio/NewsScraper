     <title>Connecticut Senate passes medical marijuana bill</title>
     <description>
      HARTFORD, Connecticut (Reuters) - The Connecticut Senate passed a bill on Saturday legalizing marijuana use for medical purposes with tight restrictions aimed at avoiding problems that have plagued some of the 16 other states where pot is now legal. After nearly 10 hours of debate, the Senate voted 21-13 in favor of the measure, which already cleared the House. Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy was expected to sign the bill. Once he does, Connecticut will join 16 other states and the District of Columbia in allowing use of marijuana to treat sick patients. ...

Same-sex marriage is illegal in North Carolina. But the state has stood out as the only one in the Southeast that has not passed a constitutional amendment solidifying such a ban. ...

     <description>
      PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona Governor Jan Brewer on Friday signed into law a bill banning abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from receiving money through the state, her office said in a statement.

     <description>
      PHOENIX (Reuters) - Surgeons in Arizona have successfully carried out a rare mother-to-child liver transplant, after a search for an organ from a deceased donor for the desperately ill 1-year-old girl came up blank, the hospital said.

Aliyah was released from the hospital this week. She and her mother were &quot;doing great,&quot; the hospital said in a statement on its website. ...

But the court battle over the Texas Women's Health Program is not finished. A hearing is scheduled for May 18 in U.S. ...

     <description>
      RALEIGH, North Carolina (Reuters) - Efforts to legalize gay marriage have met success in several U.S. states this year but could experience a setback on Tuesday if North Carolina voters decide to amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriages and civil unions. Same-sex marriage is illegal in North Carolina. But the state has stood out as the only one in the Southeast that has not passed a constitutional amendment solidifying such a ban. ...

     <description>
      HARTFORD, Connecticut (Reuters) - The Connecticut Senate passed a bill on Saturday legalizing marijuana use for medical purposes with tight restrictions aimed at avoiding problems that have plagued some of the 16 other states where pot is now legal. After nearly 10 hours of debate, the Senate voted 21-13 in favor of the measure, which already cleared the House. Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy was expected to sign the bill. Once he does, Connecticut will join 16 other states and the District of Columbia in allowing use of marijuana to treat sick patients. ...
