     <title>Original &quot;Evil Dead&quot; makers sues over proposed sequel</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - &quot;The Evil Dead,&quot; with its campy take on the horror genre, established Sam Raimi as a young director to watch when it hit theaters in 1981. Now, with several Spider-Mans and a track record as one of Hollywood's foremost hit-makers under his belt, Raimi is suing the producers of a planned sequel to the film that helped him make his name. Renaissance Pictures, the production company Raimi formed with &quot;Evil Dead&quot; producer Robert Tapert and star Bruce Campbell to make the film, is listed as a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed this week in U.S. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - Jonah Hill, fresh off an Oscar nomination for his performance in &quot;Moneyball,&quot; will star alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese's &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street.&quot; The film, still in pre-production, is based on Jordan Delfort's memoir about his meteoric rise and ignominious fall as a Wall Street trader. Delfort made millions, living of a life of the utmost extravagance only to succumb to drug and alcohol addiction. Terence Winter, creator of &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; and a lead writer on &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; adapted the book for the big screen. ...

     <title>Clean water shrinking in &quot;Last Call at the Oasis&quot;</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - If you thought only Third World countries have water crises, a new documentary asks you to think again. Increasingly, problems are rising to the surface in the United States. Filmmaker Jessica Yu harnesses the celebrity power of actor Jack Black and environmental activist Erin Brockovich - immortalized by Julia Roberts in the 2000 movie about Brockovich's work - to give the looming U.S. water crisis a thorough wringing out in &quot;Last Call at the Oasis&quot;. &quot;A third of U.S. counties face water shortage by the year 2050,&quot; Yu told Reuters. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - The Weinstein Company has acquired U.S. and Latin American rights to Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut, &quot;Quartet,&quot; the studio said Friday.

The movie boasts a script by &quot;The Pianist&quot; screenwriter Ronald Harwood. It tells the story of Reggie (Courtenay), Wilf (Billy Connolly) and Cissy (Collins) who reside in Beecham House, a home for retired opera singers. ...

Gossip blogger Hilton (real name: Mario Armando Lavandeira) has been slapped with a lawsuit after reporting that the man who designed Jolie's ring had previously been found guilty of fraud.

At least in the Twitterverse. The &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; actress ended months of speculation Thursday, finally answering the question: &quot;When is she going to change her Twitter handle?&quot; Moore had been going by @MrsKutcher, a handle that grew more awkward with each passing day since November, when she announced plans to divorce &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; star Kutcher. Moore now goes by @JustDemi. According to her account, the actress chose the new moniker because it's &quot;playful. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The film's title, &quot;The Perfect Family,&quot; is meant to be ironic with a neon yellow highlighter through it. ...

The &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; star's ad for Popchips has raised the hackles of some in the Twitterverse, who are criticizing the ad as racist because Kutcher wears &quot;brownface&quot; in it. The commercial parodies dating-service ads, with Kutcher playing Raj, a 39-year-old &quot;Bollywood producer&quot; who's looking for love. But the ad itself isn't getting much love from Internet detractors, who are criticizing the brown makeup and stereotypical behavior he displays in the spot. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
