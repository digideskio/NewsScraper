     <title>Fuel for the Fire: Graphic</title>
     <description>
      In 2008, Obama campaigned on a pledge to enact a sweeping cap-and-trade law that would slash fossil-fuel pollution, mandate increased production of renewable electricity, and spend $150 billion on clean-energy research over a decade. The bill failed in the Senate, and “cap-and-trade” has become a politically toxic phrase, but Obama has continued to pursue elements of climate-change and carbon-reduction policy. He used his executive authority to issue Environmental Protection Agency regulations to cut fossil-fuel emissions from power plants and to ramp up fuel-economy standards for vehicles. ...

     <title>Triplets Can Turn Out Just Fine; A Black Hole Murderer</title>
     <description>
      Discovered: Triplets can turn out okay, a black hole murderer is on the loose, time to start a moderate jogging routine and plants will adapt to climate change better than expected.&nbsp;Triplets can turn out alright, after&nbsp;all. Being one of three triplet means having to share things among three, which can make a person turn out a little funny, probably. This research has no implications for the personality of triplets. But, there is some good news for the well being of those born in threes. ...

     <title>Study: Texas Wind Farms Not Causing Global Warming</title>
     <description>
      A study first reported by Reuters seemed to suggest large-scale wind farms in West Texas cause localized warming of the surface. The implication was the spread of such wind farms might cause rather than alleviate global warming.
