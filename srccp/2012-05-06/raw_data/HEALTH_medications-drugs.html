     <title>Fewer jobs means more spending on U.S. Medicaid</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Millions of people turned to the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor during the 2007-2009 recession as families coped with job losses and drastic drops in income, pushing Medicaid spending up by an average of 6.6 percent per year, according to a study released on Friday. The study by the nonprofit Kaiser Foundation found that state and federal spending on the program, which states administer with partial reimbursements from the U.S. government, grew to $400 billion in 2010 from $330 billion in 2007. That represents an average annual increase of 6. ...

     <title>Some support for quit-smoking alternatives</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Acupuncture and hypnosis are touted as drug-free ways to help smokers kick the habit, and there is some evidence that they work, according to a new research review. There are still plenty of questions -- including exactly how effective the alternative therapies might be, and how they measure up against standard quit tactics. But researchers say the alternatives should stand as options for smokers who want them. The findings, reported in the American Journal of Medicine, come from a review of 14 previous clinical trials. ...
