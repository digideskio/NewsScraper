     <title>Japan Wrong in Shunning Nuclear Power</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to the Associated Press, this weekend, thousands of people in Japan celebrated as the last of the country's nuclear reactors was shut off. Those people are envisioning a world where their children can live without the risk of nuclear disasters. While I share the vision -- and hope -- of a safer world for my children, and I understand that the meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant last years was a serious issue, I disagree with Japan's decision to turn away from nuclear power.

     <title>EPA's Armendariz Resigns for Revealing Crucify Comment</title>

      COMMENTARY | Al Armendariz, a senior EPA official, has had to fall on his own sword after using a crucifixion analogy back in 2010. While the firestorm centers on the wording, the intent is far more worrisome. While &quot;making an example&quot; of someone is not uncommon as a preventative, Armendariz's own words seem a bit more far reaching.

     <title>Delta Buys Oil Refinery -- Start of a Wider Trend?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Fuel prices are sky high and continue to rise. Just as they affect drivers at the pump, they also have a huge impact on airlines, which translates into higher ticket prices for flyers like me. Airlines burn through billions of gallons of jet fuel each year, and each increase in price directly affects their bottom line. Delta Air Lines used 3.9 billion gallons of fuel last year. That fuel cost the airline $11.8 billion, which was 36 percent of its overall operating expenses, The Associated Press reports.
