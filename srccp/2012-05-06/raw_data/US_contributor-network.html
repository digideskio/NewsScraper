     <title>Gary Johnson is Back, and That's a Good Thing</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to the Associated Press, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson is back in the political saddle, easily winning the spot of presidential nominee of the Libertarian Party. Johnson began his presidential campaign as a Republican but was quickly overlooked by the media, eventually leaving the GOP race and focusing on running as a libertarian. The media's dismissal of the two-term governor became controversial when Johnson publicly complained he was not even being invited to debates.

     <title>Japan Wrong in Shunning Nuclear Power</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to the Associated Press, this weekend, thousands of people in Japan celebrated as the last of the country's nuclear reactors was shut off. Those people are envisioning a world where their children can live without the risk of nuclear disasters. While I share the vision -- and hope -- of a safer world for my children, and I understand that the meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant last years was a serious issue, I disagree with Japan's decision to turn away from nuclear power.

     <title>Why is the Jobs Report Crucial to the Presidential Outcome?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | I could just as easily ask why any report is crucial to the presidential outcome, but this in response to the article &quot;Jobs report crucial to presidential election outcome&quot; written in response to the Labor Department's April jobs report. I find it to be sensationalized &quot;news&quot; based on government reports and political innuendo primarily designed to generate reader traffic.

     <title>Iowa Republicans Might Not Help Romney Win Over Women</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | As a swing state, Iowa is up for grabs in the general election. Like other states, Iowans are divided on the issues that will play a role in this year's election. But the unemployment rate is 5.2 percent, well below the national average of 8.1 percent. Spurred by an uptick in manufacturing and construction, and with the Iowa economy on the rebound, Mitt Romney needs to work on closing the gender gap. Unfortunately, the Republican-held House in Iowa has taken on the same agenda as other GOP-run states -- attacking a reliable and key voting group.

     <title>Anti-Gay Marriage Amendment May Drive North Carolina Toward Obama</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Swing state North Carolina is facing an unusual ballot choice in its Tuesday primary. Called Proposition One, the constitutional amendment says &quot;Marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state.&quot; But not only does North Carolina already have a law forbidding same-sex marriages, if the amendment passes it could have some unintended consequences, like a Barack Obama victory for the state.

     <title>Fracking Changes Coming to Pennsylvania</title>
     <description>
      Fracking in Pennsylvania has led the state being self-sufficient with regard to the supply of natural gas needed by residents, according to a report from MarcellusCoalition.org. But the natural gas industry is facing a series of hurdles, not the least of which are new requirements set by the Department of Interior for drilling for the natural resource on federal land, according to the Associated Press. New rules on well construction, wastewater disposal and disclosure of chemicals used in the process are part of a new package rolled out by the Obama administration.

     <title>Airfares and Fees Set to Rise Further</title>
     <description>
      Despite a Los Angeles Times report that the average domestic airfare was at a record high of $364 in 2011, the future likely does not hold any massive discounting for consumers. CNN reports airfares and airline fees are expected to increase further as airlines struggle to soft demand and high fuel prices. CNN adds the heyday of national air carriers could be coming to an end through mergers, acquisitions and other consolidation methods. Airlines are trying to stay in the black in what is increasingly a tough travel market.

      COMMENTARY| The U.K.'s Conservative Party (the senior partner in the national ruling coalition) suffered heavy defeats in local council elections across the country Thursday, losing over 400 seats while the Labor Party gained over 800, according to the BBC.
