     <title>Pandora, Spotify face off in free online music market</title>
     <description>
      NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - It took decades for music delivery to evolve from vinyl records to CDs and years to go from CDs to MP3 players. Now Internet radio is shaping up as competition for digital audio players by providing free online music streaming from websites such as Pandora and Spotify. Singer-songwriter Theresa Andersson had just wrapped up a set at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and new fan Dana Spanierman was already planning how she could hear similar bluesy harmonies. ...

     <title>Architects hit the road to survive property crash</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Working for one of the world's best-known architecture firms, Norman Morgan and Brent Sparks were used to new business landing on their desks. But when the financial crisis struck in 2008, they abandoned the Fort Worth office of HKS Inc, jumped into Morgan's Ford pick-up truck and began to criss-cross the back lands of Texas, looking for any kind of jobs for the firm. On their road-trip, they knocked on the doors of rural Texas hospitals they spotted from the highway, often with no appointment. Architects from rival firms were also on the ground, trying to drum up new clients. ...

     <description>
      SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China wants energy-efficient buildings to account for 30 percent of all new construction projects by 2020 to bring its building energy consumption ratio closer to that of developed countries, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday. In order to achieve that goal, the government will step up incentives for green buildings, improve industry standards and promote technological improvements and the development of related industries, Xinhua reported, citing a document released by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. ...

     <title>India to deliberate tax measures as investors fret</title>
     <description>
      MUMBAI (Reuters) - Whatever its intentions in cracking down on abuse of tax havens, India has alienated overseas investors with the timing and communication of its measures when it can ill afford to do so. India's move to target tax evaders through a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR), along with a plan to retroactively tax the indirect transfer of assets, has spooked investors and added to an exodus of funds, battering the rupee. ...

     <title>Kazakh copper miner offers wage rise to end strike</title>
     <description>
      ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakh copper miner Kazakhmys agreed on Sunday to raise wages if about 300 workers call off an underground protest that has unnerved authorities in the Central Asian state following deadly riots in an oil town. London-listed Kazakhmys, the world's 11th-largest copper producer, sent senior managers to negotiate with the miners in central Kazakhstan and said it would not punish striking workers if they agreed to enter constructive talks. Around 80 miners failed to emerge after their Friday shift at the Annensky underground mine came to an end. ...

The agreement, signed on Saturday, provided a showcase for president-elect Vladimir Putin, serving out his final days as prime minister before a May 7 inauguration, and Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, in charge of energy and industrial policy. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Romania seals deal with IMF to raise public wages</title>
     <description>
      BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania has sealed an agreement with international lenders to restore public wages to their previous levels, a senior official said, as part of the government's efforts to ease an unpopular austerity program. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Romania has some space to ease austerity, which included a 25 percent cut in public sector salaries in 2010. Some have since been restored. Romania's centre-right government collapsed in April when it lost a vote of confidence in parliament, underscoring public dissatisfaction with its austerity program. ...

The 170-year-old firm warned about its profits three times last year as civil unrest in North Africa and the economic downturn in Britain hurt bookings, and it has been forced to consider a number of fundraising proposals. ...

      TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's Arabian Gulf Oil Company (Agoco) has cut oil production by another 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) due to protests that have closed off its headquarters for nearly two weeks, a spokesman said on Saturday. Protesters have prevented employees from entering Agoco's office since April 23, calling for more transparency over how Libya's new rulers are spending its money and more jobs for youth. Agoco, based in the eastern city of Benghazi, had threatened to cut production if no solution was found by May 3. ...

He did not identify the takeover target. Buffett also said that if Berkshire did not make a major deal this year, it could look at one larger than $30 billion next year. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
