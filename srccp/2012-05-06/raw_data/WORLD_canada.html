     <title>Small gain seen in Canadian jobs in April</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Canada will be fortunate if it registered much of an employment increase in April after March's outsized gain of 82,300 jobs. Data out on May 11 is forecast to show a much smaller 7,000 gain, and the unemployment rate edging back up a tick to 7.3 percent, after having fallen in March to 7.2 percent from 7.4 percent. The consensus of 2 3 economists surveyed by Reuters is that March's surge [ID:nSCL5FE87O] was a one-off gain, with several predicting a reactive fall and none of the rest seeing employment rising at that rate for a second month. ...

     <title>Canada pipeline delays won't stop China investment</title>
     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Delays in building pipelines to carry oil from the oil sands of Alberta to Canada's West Coast for shipment to Asia should not squelch a boom in investments in the country's energy resources by Chinese companies, China's ambassador to Canada said on Friday. Spending by Chinese state-owned enterprises in Canadian oil sands and shale gas companies and projects has hit roughly C$20 billion ($20.1 billion), with the first priorities to learn about the business and show a profit, Zhang Junsai told reporters after speaking to a conference on Chinese investment in Canada. ...

     <title>Canadian killer on Montana's death row seeks clemency</title>
     <description>
      DEER LODGE, Montana (Reuters) - The sole Canadian on death row in the United States asked Montana's parole board for clemency on Wednesday, saying he was a changed man who felt &quot;horrendously sorry&quot; for murdering two young men 30 years ago on an Indian reservation. Ronald Smith's plea came during a hearing that marked the first time the 54-year-old convicted killer, who once said he committed the murders in a drunken, drug-fueled rage because he &quot;wanted to know what it felt like,&quot; heard directly from relatives of his victims. ...

     <title>Egypt foreign reserves see first gain since 2010</title>
     <description>
      CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's foreign reserves rose slightly last month, central bank data showed on Sunday, their first gain since a popular uprising unseated the country's autocratic leader and sent the economy into a tailspin. The central bank has spent heavily to support Egypt's currency through the political turmoil since Hosni Mubarak's overthrow in February 2011, which prompted foreign investors to scurry for the exit and hammered tourism. Foreign reserves - which stood at $36 billion in December 2010 and fell every month since the uprising began - edged up to $15. ...

      ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakh copper miner Kazakhmys agreed on Sunday to raise wages if about 300 workers call off an underground protest that has unnerved authorities in the Central Asian state following deadly riots in an oil town. London-listed Kazakhmys, the world's 11th-largest copper producer, sent senior managers to negotiate with the miners in central Kazakhstan and said it would not punish striking workers if they agreed to enter constructive talks. Around 80 miners failed to emerge after their Friday shift at the Annensky underground mine came to an end. ...
