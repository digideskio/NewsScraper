     <title>Merkel's party in dead-heat with rivals in state vote</title>
     <description>
      BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives are in a dead-heat with the rival Social Democrats (SPD) for first place in an election in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, exit polls showed on Sunday. German TV network ARD showed Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) on 30.5 percent and the SPD on 29.5 percent based on the first exit polls after the voting stations closed at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT). The result would give both parties 22 seats in the 69-seat assembly. ...

     <title>Taliban stronger than before U.S. troop surge: lawmakers</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Taliban is stronger now than before President Barack Obama ordered a surge of troops to Afghanistan, two senior U.S. lawmakers said on Sunday, contradicting the administration's assessment of the insurgency. &quot;I think we both say that what we found is the Taliban is stronger,&quot; Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein told &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; in an interview that included House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, who agreed with her statement. The two lawmakers returned last week from a trip to Afghanistan. ...

     <title>Greece's pro-bailout parties take a beating: exit poll</title>
     <description>
      ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's conservative New Democracy and Socialist PASOK parties risked falling short of the 151-seat majority needed to form a coalition government after Sunday's general election, an exit poll from Kapa Research showed. The poll for Reuters and To Vima newspaper showed New Democracy taking 16-19 percent of the vote, well below projections of up to 25 percent last month, while PASOK took 15-18 percent. The anti-bailout Left Coalition party was set to challenge PASOK for second place with 15-18 percent of the vote. ...

      YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenians looked set to return the two biggest parties in the ruling coalition to power on Sunday, in an election they hope will be free of the fraud and violence that marred the South Caucasus country's last national election in 2007. President Serzh Sarksyan's Republican Party and Prosperous Armenia, led by businessman Gagik Tsarukyan, were expected to remain in charge of the former Soviet republic, and the poll is seen as a test of strength between the two parties. ...

      MOSCOW (Reuters) - Riot police hauled away dozens of protesters and at least two opposition leaders on Sunday after scuffles broke out at a demonstration against Vladimir Putin's return to Russia's presidency, witnesses said. A long line of OMON riot police held back protesters at a square across the Moscow river from the Kremlin and beat some with batons. Some of the protesters threw plastic bottles and one threw a smoke bomb, Reuters reporters on the scene said. Those taken away by police included two opposition leaders, Alexei Navalny and Sergei Udaltsov, the witnesses said. ...

     <description>
      JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to announce on Sunday an early general election on September 4, a spokesman for his Likud party said, a ballot likely to strengthen his hand as Israel confronts Iran's nuclear ambitions. The next national vote was not due until October 2013, but new legislation that might force ultra-Orthodox Jews to serve in the military and an upcoming budget debate have threatened to unravel a governing coalition of religious and nationalist parties once seen as one of the most stable in Israel's history. ...

      VIENNA (Reuters) - Jailed Ukrainian former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko is heartened by international support for her plight and will press on with her hunger strike against her treatment in prison, her daughter told an Austrian newspaper. Tymoshenko, 51, has had an &quot;enormous&quot; psychological boost from the diplomatic backlash that has led to calls for politicians to boycott the Euro 2012 soccer championships in Ukraine, which will co-host the event with Poland, Oesterreich quoted Yevgenia Tymoshenko as saying. ...

Buoyed by a tide of anger at Sarkozy's inability to rein in rampant unemployment during his five-year term, Hollande was between four and eight points ahead in final opinion polls for Sunday's vote, which takes place alongside a Greek parliamentary election expected to punish leading parties for economic misery. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
