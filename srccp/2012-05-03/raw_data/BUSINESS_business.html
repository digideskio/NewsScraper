Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 27,000, the biggest weekly drop since May 2011. The report ran counter to data indicating weaker private sector hiring that pushed stocks lower Wednesday. But a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed the pace of growth in the U.S. services sector slowed more than expected in April and new orders dropped. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>U.S. productivity drops in Q1, hours rise strongly</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nonfarm productivity fell in the first quarter as companies hired more workers to maintain output, but a moderate rise in wages suggested little pressure on company profits and inflation. Productivity slipped at a 0.5 percent annual rate, the Labor Department said on Thursday, after rising at an upwardly revised 1.2 percent rate in the last three months of 2011. The decline in productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, was in line with expectations. Fourth-quarter productivity had been previously reported to have increased at a 0.9 percent rate. ...

Net income fell to $577 million from $676 million in the year-ago quarter. The drop was mainly due to derivatives losses totaling $1.06 billion, up from $427 million a year earlier and $766 million in the previous 3-month period.

Net income fell to $577 million from $676 million in the year-ago quarter. The drop was mainly due to derivatives losses totaling $1.06 billion, up from $427 million a year earlier and $766 million in the previous 3-month period.

     <description>
      ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS became the latest bank to face the anger of its shareholders over executive pay on Thursday, as investors queued up to voice their complaints in a packed meeting that echoed recent protests at Credit Suisse and Barclays. &quot;Big banker pay hasn't been tamed at all. It's as though UBS hasn't learned any lessons at all from the past crises,&quot; Brigitta Moser-Harder, a small investor, told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting attended by around 3,400 shareholders. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Legendary natural gas trader John Arnold is closing down his flagship Centaurus fund, sources said o n Wednesday, ending an era in which the former Enron wunderkind defined the high-risk, big-reward energy speculator. After two years of struggling to maintain outsized returns as gas prices sank to 10-year lows and trading regulations grew tighter, Arnold told investors he would return their funds and pursue &quot;other interests,&quot; according to an investor in the fund who had received the letter. ...

      SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Contract workers on Thursday blocked some roads to Chile's giant Escondida mine, but a deal to end the unrest at the world's No. 1 copper mine was &quot;imminent,&quot; a union leader said in a disruption both he and majority owner BHP Billiton said had not affected output. The vice president of Escondida's contract workers union, Roberto Rojas, told Reuters the partial blockade could &quot;possibly&quot; be lifted later on Thursday if an agreement is clinched. &quot;The blockades continue ... We're starting to see the lights of an agreement. ...

Michael Grimm, a first-term Republican congressman from New York City and member of the House Financial Services Committee, has circulated to colleagues a proposed letter that would ask U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to step aside. The move comes roughly six months after a bankruptcy filing by MF Global, which had been run by former Democratic U.S. Senator and New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans on Thursday scheduled a trial for January 14, 2013, more than 10 months after it had originally been scheduled. The decision means the federal government and Gulf Coast states, which also wanted a summer trial, may have to wait longer to recover money from BP Plc and its drilling partners. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Slim's cash cow, mobile giant America Movil, said on Thursday it had agreed with Mexico's Federal Competition Commission (Cofeco) to cut by about 20 percent its interconnection rates, the fees it charges rivals to tap its mobile network. Analysts said the deal was a minor setback to Slim, and shares in America Movil even rose slightly. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The company has now drawn $72.3 billion from the U.S. Treasury since being seized by the government in 2008, and has returned $18.3 billion as the price for the taxpayer support.

     <title>U.S. productivity drops in Q1, hours rise strongly</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nonfarm productivity fell in the first quarter as companies hired more workers to maintain output, but a moderate rise in wages suggested little pressure on company profits and inflation. Productivity slipped at a 0.5 percent annual rate, the Labor Department said on Thursday, after rising at an upwardly revised 1.2 percent rate in the last three months of 2011. The decline in productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, was in line with expectations. Fourth-quarter productivity had been previously reported to have increased at a 0.9 percent rate. ...

     <description>
      HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - To the list of unexpected windfalls created by the boom in shale gas production, add one more: The full-time philanthropy of billionaire trader John Arnold. Tired of struggling to eke out gains in a natural gas market that has been deluged by an unyielding surplus of supply, Arnold announced on Wednesday that he would wind down his Centaurus hedge fund after a decade of unparalleled returns. The fund was flat this year through March, according to an industry source. ...

      BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's highest court overturned an injunction that had suspended collection of disputed tax claims from Vale SA , the world's largest iron-ore producer, the company said on Thursday, adding it would appeal the ruling. The miner is fighting four tax bills issued by the federal tax authority, totaling 30.5 billion reals ($15.83 billion) on its earnings abroad. Vale said this is tantamount to double taxation as it paid taxes to foreign governments. ...
