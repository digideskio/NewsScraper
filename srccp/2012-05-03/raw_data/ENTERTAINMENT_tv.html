Two other employees have been disciplined over the tape edit, which aired on March 19. ...

     <title>Mick Jagger to host, perform on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Mick Jagger will host &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the first time on May 19, bringing the sketch comedy's season to a close, NBC television said on Thursday. The Rolling Stones frontman has performed twice on the long-running satirical program in the past, but this will be his first hosting gig. Jagger, 68, will also perform. Jagger also made a famous cameo appearance on the show in 2001 for a skit in which comedian Jimmy Fallon mimicked the rocker's iconic moves in a mirror.

But as Emmy contenders submit their best work this week, those who have been through the process told TheWrap, again and again, that flexibility is key. Not just about which episode to submit. Entrants also need to be open-minded about which category to enter, and even the genre. ...

      TUNIS (Reuters) - A Tunisian court on Thursday fined a television boss 2,400 dinars ($1,550) for showing the award winning film &quot;Persepolis&quot; after a trial that deepened a growing divide between Islamists and secularists.
