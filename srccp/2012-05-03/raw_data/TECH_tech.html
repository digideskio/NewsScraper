     <title>The Daily delight on iPhone</title>
     <description>
      In February of last year, The Daily, a new magazine designed just for the iPad with lots of digital features, was released to user and critical acclaim. The app offers a mix of headlines, videos and reports on seven topics including news, business, gossip, opinion, arts and life, apps and games, and sports. It’s glossy, slick, full of graphics and very 21st century. As of today, it’s available for iPhone users, too. The Daily for iPhone has all the same features as The Daily on iPad, but formatted for a great reading experience on the small screen.

Samsung has gone to great lengths to keep its new flagship phone under wraps, but an inevitable series of leaks paints what is likely a complete picture of the Galaxy S III.

     <title>Will the Samsung Galaxy S III expand beyond Android’s ecosystem?</title>
     <description>
      Any moment now we’ll hear from Samsung’s London event their plans for the latest Galaxy device, expected to be the S III. Speculation has been rampant, with high hopes for a 4.8-inch screen boasting a 720p Super AMOLED panel, likely a non-pentile Super AMOLED HD+ at that.

Multiple reports have suggested that the new iPhone will feature a 4-inch screen, and iLounge’s Jeremy Horowitz is throwing his weight behind it as well. Additionally, he’s reporting that the device will be taller and 20% thinner than the current iPhone 4S. The back of the device will have a metal panel according to the report, though it won’t cover the entire back of the phone. This seems a little strange, especially with iLounge’s rendering.

      DUBLIN (Reuters) - German business software group SAP AG will hire 250 more people at its Irish operations, the company said on Thursday, in the latest boost to an economy which has one of the worst jobless rates in Europe. Irish unemployment has stayed above 14 percent for almost two years and is forecast to fall to just 11.7 percent by 2015 even though employment rose for the first time in four years in the final quarter of last year. ...

The Cupertino-based company’s market share increased by 7% in the first quarter year-over-year and totaled 29% of all U.S. smartphones. Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone and overall mobile phone vendor, followed closely on Apple’s heels and saw tremendous growth of 140% to grab a 24% share of the market.

     <description>
      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The rich are going to get richer when Silicon Valley's biggest IPO starts trading. Facebook is only getting about half -- or $5.6 billion -- of the roughly $10.6 billion it plans to raise via a mega IPO. The other half, or about $4.9 billon, is going to a handful of inside investors -- many Silicon Valley notables. Chief among them are co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, venture firm Accel Partners, early investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Russian tycoon Yuri Milner's DST, and investment bank Goldman Sachs. ...
