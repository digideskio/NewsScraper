Bean defended the bank's stimulatory policy stance, which has come under renewed criticism as Britain slid into its second recession since the financial crisis. &quot;The present highly stimulatory policy stance means activity, employment and asset prices are all higher than they would otherwise be,&quot; said Bean. ...

Tucker is leading global efforts at the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to require supervisors in the world's top 20 economies to have recovery and resolution plans for major banks by the end of this year.
