The three-time All Star Longoria left Monday's game against Seattle after he tried to reach second base on a steal. He was initially said to be day-to-day but further examination revealed a more serious injury. &quot;I mean I'm thinking it (stinks),&quot; Longoria told the team's website (tampabay.rays.mlb.com). &quot;It's one of those things where my job now is just to stay positive. As tough as it's going to be to watch, I can't really worry about it right now. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
