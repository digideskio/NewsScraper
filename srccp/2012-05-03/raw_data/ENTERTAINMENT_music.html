The experimental singer-songwriter has teamed with popular British DJ and music producer Mark Ronson, who helped create Amy Winehouse's &quot;Back to Black,&quot; for what is being touted as Wainwright's most commercial album yet, &quot;Out of the Game,&quot; released in the United States on Tuesday. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Yes, there is discussion of his music, the 40th anniversary world tour of the progressive rock classic &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, and of its 2012 follow up. But there is also a lot more about flutes in space, an unlikely link with the George W. Bush White House - and the importance of prostate examinations. Anderson, now 64 and dapper rather than the frenzied druid-cum-warlock of yore, is quite clear and animated about the latter. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Review: &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack comes up skimpy</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - There's an old adage that goes &quot;Leave â€˜em wanting more,&quot; and although that may not be a specifically Broadway or TV adage, it's been adopted for the &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack album, which solves the problem of whether to fill the disc up with pop covers or musical-comedy originals by not offering enough of either. Another five-letter S-word would seem to apply: s-k-i-m-p. ...

     <title>Jack White scores first No. 1 album with &quot;Blunderbuss&quot;</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Jack White scored his first No. 1 album ever on Wednesday as his debut solo &quot;Blunderbuss&quot; topped the Billboard 200, while the record also reigned over music charts in the United Kingdom, Canada and Switzerland in its initial week. &quot;Blunderbuss,&quot; which sold 138,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan, notched seven top ten albums with his former band The White Stripes and side projects the Dead Weather and The Raconteurs. ...

     <title>Review: Underwood's &quot;Blown Away&quot; is a breeze</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It's a good thing that you can't judge a book by its sleeve art, because Carrie Underwood's fourth album, &quot;Blown Away,&quot; arrives this week bearing one of the tackiest country music album covers of all time - a ludicrously airbrushed portrait that dares you not to focus on Underwood's gleaming, Angelina-like right gam while the star gazes into the distance like a fembot on a romance-novel jacket. It's a relief to find the music inside is better... sometimes, much better. ...

     <title>Review: Harrison's &quot;Early Takes&quot; is beautifully bare</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Back in 2003, the surviving Beatles authorized the release of &quot;Let It Be... Naked,&quot; an album of remixes that stripped away the most outlandish production flourishes producer Phil Spector had added to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 1970. In a way, the new George Harrison release &quot;Early Takes, Volume 1&quot; does the same thing for the former Beatle's Spector-produced 1970 solo debut, &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; as, among other selections, it offers up six songs from that landmark effort in completely unvarnished form. ...

Gotye has enjoyed a rapid rise in fame, not just in the U.S. but around the world, for the song of a failed relationship that features New Zealand artist Kimbra.

Yes, there is discussion of his music, the 40th anniversary world tour of the progressive rock classic &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, and of its 2012 follow up. But there is also a lot more about flutes in space, an unlikely link with the George W. Bush White House - and the importance of prostate examinations. Anderson, now 64 and dapper rather than the frenzied druid-cum-warlock of yore, is quite clear and animated about the latter. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Review: &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack comes up skimpy</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - There's an old adage that goes &quot;Leave â€˜em wanting more,&quot; and although that may not be a specifically Broadway or TV adage, it's been adopted for the &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack album, which solves the problem of whether to fill the disc up with pop covers or musical-comedy originals by not offering enough of either. Another five-letter S-word would seem to apply: s-k-i-m-p. ...

      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Jack White scored his first No. 1 album ever on Wednesday as his debut solo &quot;Blunderbuss&quot; topped the Billboard 200, while the record also reigned over music charts in the United Kingdom, Canada and Switzerland in its initial week. &quot;Blunderbuss,&quot; which sold 138,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan, notched seven top ten albums with his former band The White Stripes and side projects the Dead Weather and The Raconteurs. ...

     <title>Review: Underwood's &quot;Blown Away&quot; is a breeze</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It's a good thing that you can't judge a book by its sleeve art, because Carrie Underwood's fourth album, &quot;Blown Away,&quot; arrives this week bearing one of the tackiest country music album covers of all time - a ludicrously airbrushed portrait that dares you not to focus on Underwood's gleaming, Angelina-like right gam while the star gazes into the distance like a fembot on a romance-novel jacket. It's a relief to find the music inside is better... sometimes, much better. ...

     <title>Review: Harrison's &quot;Early Takes&quot; is beautifully bare</title>
     <description>

REUTERS/Pepsico&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Reuters) - Michael Jackson is dancing again, on Pepsi cans. The soft drink maker and the estate for the late pop star on Thursday unveiled plans to put the singer's silhouette on one billion soft drink cans in a global pop culture ad campaign. The late King of Pop, who pitched Pepsi in 1980s commercials as &quot;the choice of a new generation&quot;, will appear in some of his iconic dance poses for the promotion, which will also coincide with the 25th anniversary of the singer's &quot;Bad&quot; album. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Yes, there is discussion of his music, the 40th anniversary world tour of the progressive rock classic &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, and of its 2012 follow up. But there is also a lot more about flutes in space, an unlikely link with the George W. Bush White House - and the importance of prostate examinations. Anderson, now 64 and dapper rather than the frenzied druid-cum-warlock of yore, is quite clear and animated about the latter. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Review: &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack comes up skimpy</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - There's an old adage that goes &quot;Leave â€˜em wanting more,&quot; and although that may not be a specifically Broadway or TV adage, it's been adopted for the &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack album, which solves the problem of whether to fill the disc up with pop covers or musical-comedy originals by not offering enough of either. Another five-letter S-word would seem to apply: s-k-i-m-p. ...

      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Jack White scored his first No. 1 album ever on Wednesday as his debut solo &quot;Blunderbuss&quot; topped the Billboard 200, while the record also reigned over music charts in the United Kingdom, Canada and Switzerland in its initial week. &quot;Blunderbuss,&quot; which sold 138,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan, notched seven top ten albums with his former band The White Stripes and side projects the Dead Weather and The Raconteurs. ...

     <title>Review: Underwood's &quot;Blown Away&quot; is a breeze</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It's a good thing that you can't judge a book by its sleeve art, because Carrie Underwood's fourth album, &quot;Blown Away,&quot; arrives this week bearing one of the tackiest country music album covers of all time - a ludicrously airbrushed portrait that dares you not to focus on Underwood's gleaming, Angelina-like right gam while the star gazes into the distance like a fembot on a romance-novel jacket. It's a relief to find the music inside is better... sometimes, much better. ...

     <title>Review: Harrison's &quot;Early Takes&quot; is beautifully bare</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Back in 2003, the surviving Beatles authorized the release of &quot;Let It Be... Naked,&quot; an album of remixes that stripped away the most outlandish production flourishes producer Phil Spector had added to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 1970. In a way, the new George Harrison release &quot;Early Takes, Volume 1&quot; does the same thing for the former Beatle's Spector-produced 1970 solo debut, &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; as, among other selections, it offers up six songs from that landmark effort in completely unvarnished form. ...
