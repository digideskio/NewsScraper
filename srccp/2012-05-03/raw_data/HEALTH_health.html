     <title>Vitamins E, C no help against vision disorder</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Taking vitamins E and C may do nothing to protect aging eyes from macular degeneration -- the leading cause of vision loss in older adults, a new clinical trial finds. Researchers had been hoping the vitamins, both antioxidants, could shield against the tissue erosion that occurs in macular degeneration. The condition involves damage to the center of the retina, which makes it hard to see fine details. Studies have found that people who get more antioxidants in their diet have a lower risk of macular degeneration. ...

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - With U.S. biomedical research under assault by everyone from patients to Congress for turning so few scientific discoveries into treatments, a leading finance expert says decisions about what studies to bankroll should be made the same way pension funds, mutual funds, and university endowments decide how to invest their money. Those decisions should be guided by &quot;financial portfolio theory,&quot; argues a paper published Wednesday in the science journal PLoS ONE. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Indian drugmaker Dr Reddy's Laboratories has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval for selling ibandronate sodium tablets used to treat osteoporosis, the regulator's website showed on Thursday. The tablets are the generic version of Boniva, a brand sold by a unit of Swiss drugmaker Roche. Cipla, another Indian drugmaker, received U.S. regulatory approval for AIDS treatment drug nevirapine, the website showed. The drug is a generic version of German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim's Viramune tablets. (Reporting by Kaustubh Kulkarni in MUMBAI)
