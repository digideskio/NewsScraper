     <title>Eleventh Commandment: Thou Shall Support the Welfare State</title>
     <description>
      As a candidate for the presidency, George W. Bush took heat for supposedly saying something like, &quot;God wanted me to become president.&quot; He never said that. But no matter. Here comes another yet another Bible-banging religious conservative &quot;taking his marching orders from God.&quot; Apparently, if you feel God endorses a particular path, God wants you to keep the news to yourself.

     <title>Why Obama's bin Laden Ad Drives Republicans Crazy</title>
     <description>
      Nothing aggravates Republicans like seeing nasty, effective tactics upon which they have so long relied being turned against one of their candidates. So when Barack Obama's re-election campaign aired an ad celebrating the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death — and suggesting that Mitt Romney wouldn't have achieved that objective — the right exploded with outraged protests.

     <title>DEPORT THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT</title>
     <description>
      On no issue is the elite/American divide so great as on immigration. For decades, a majority of Americans have wanted to decrease immigration. Not just illegal immigration -- all immigration.Nearly three times as many Americans support reducing immigration as want it to stay the same, according to Gallup polls. A grand total of 5 percent of the population want to increase legal immigration -- 10 times less than want to decrease it. I myself would like to deport the people responsible for our current immigration policies. ...

     <title>A HARSH LESSON</title>
     <description>
      Obama Snubs Hard-Working College StudentsShortly after becoming president, Barack Obama said that he strongly supports continuing education. &quot;If we want to come out of this recession stronger than before, we need to make sure that our workforce is better prepared than ever before,&quot; he said in 2009. &quot;Right now, someone who doesn't have a college degree is more than twice as likely to be unemployed as someone who does. And so many of the Americans who have lost their jobs can't find new ones because they simply don't have the skills and the training they need for the jobs they want. ...

     <title>Eleventh Commandment: Thou Shall Support the Welfare State</title>
     <description>
      As a candidate for the presidency, George W. Bush took heat for supposedly saying something like, &quot;God wanted me to become president.&quot; He never said that. But no matter. Here comes another yet another Bible-banging religious conservative &quot;taking his marching orders from God.&quot; Apparently, if you feel God endorses a particular path, God wants you to keep the news to yourself.

     <title>Why Obama's bin Laden Ad Drives Republicans Crazy</title>
     <description>
      Nothing aggravates Republicans like seeing nasty, effective tactics upon which they have so long relied being turned against one of their candidates. So when Barack Obama's re-election campaign aired an ad celebrating the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death — and suggesting that Mitt Romney wouldn't have achieved that objective — the right exploded with outraged protests.

     <title>DEPORT THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT</title>
     <description>
      On no issue is the elite/American divide so great as on immigration. For decades, a majority of Americans have wanted to decrease immigration. Not just illegal immigration -- all immigration.Nearly three times as many Americans support reducing immigration as want it to stay the same, according to Gallup polls. A grand total of 5 percent of the population want to increase legal immigration -- 10 times less than want to decrease it. I myself would like to deport the people responsible for our current immigration policies. ...

     <title>A HARSH LESSON</title>
     <description>
      Obama Snubs Hard-Working College StudentsShortly after becoming president, Barack Obama said that he strongly supports continuing education. &quot;If we want to come out of this recession stronger than before, we need to make sure that our workforce is better prepared than ever before,&quot; he said in 2009. &quot;Right now, someone who doesn't have a college degree is more than twice as likely to be unemployed as someone who does. And so many of the Americans who have lost their jobs can't find new ones because they simply don't have the skills and the training they need for the jobs they want. ...

     <title>Why Obama's bin Laden Ad Drives Republicans Crazy</title>
     <description>
      Nothing aggravates Republicans like seeing nasty, effective tactics upon which they have so long relied being turned against one of their candidates. So when Barack Obama's re-election campaign aired an ad celebrating the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death — and suggesting that Mitt Romney wouldn't have achieved that objective — the right exploded with outraged protests.

     <title>Eleventh Commandment: Thou Shall Support the Welfare State</title>
     <description>
      As a candidate for the presidency, George W. Bush took heat for supposedly saying something like, &quot;God wanted me to become president.&quot; He never said that. But no matter. Here comes another yet another Bible-banging religious conservative &quot;taking his marching orders from God.&quot; Apparently, if you feel God endorses a particular path, God wants you to keep the news to yourself.

     <title>DEPORT THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT</title>
     <description>
      On no issue is the elite/American divide so great as on immigration. For decades, a majority of Americans have wanted to decrease immigration. Not just illegal immigration -- all immigration.Nearly three times as many Americans support reducing immigration as want it to stay the same, according to Gallup polls. A grand total of 5 percent of the population want to increase legal immigration -- 10 times less than want to decrease it. I myself would like to deport the people responsible for our current immigration policies. ...

     <title>A HARSH LESSON</title>
     <description>
      Obama Snubs Hard-Working College StudentsShortly after becoming president, Barack Obama said that he strongly supports continuing education. &quot;If we want to come out of this recession stronger than before, we need to make sure that our workforce is better prepared than ever before,&quot; he said in 2009. &quot;Right now, someone who doesn't have a college degree is more than twice as likely to be unemployed as someone who does. And so many of the Americans who have lost their jobs can't find new ones because they simply don't have the skills and the training they need for the jobs they want. ...
