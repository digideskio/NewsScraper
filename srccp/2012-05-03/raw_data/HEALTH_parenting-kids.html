     <title>Preschooler Locked in Day Care Shows Gross Staff Negligence</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The story of the Massachusetts father who broke his 3-year-old daughter out of her day care center after staff had left is alarming on many levels. According to the Associated Press, Keith Paquette says when he got to Westport Country Day School shortly after 5 p.m., no one was there. He says he was forced to smash a window to release his daughter Samantha Jo because the building was locked.

     <title>Tanning Booth Mom Needs Lessons on More Than Just Parenting</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to The Sideshow, New Jersey mom Patricia Krentcil says her arrest for putting her 5-year-old daughter in a tanning booth was just a misunderstanding. It's hard, however, when looking at the image of Krentcil to misunderstand her questionable act of parenting is not the only problem she has. Her need to bake herself to a burnt-toast color in a tanning bed is a problem as well.

     <title>Kids on cow farms may have fewer allergies</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Kids who grow up on farms and have contact with cows and cow milk are less likely to have allergies and asthma than kids raised nearby but not on a farm, according to a new study from Europe. Researchers had previously noticed that kids raised on European farms have lower rates of asthma and allergies than other children (see Reuters Health story of June 1, 2010). But the new findings help identify, at least in part, what specifically may protect some farm-raised youngsters against developing asthma or allergies. &quot;Nature can really teach us something here,&quot; said Dr. ...

The babies were born one week premature. About 15 million premature babies are born every year _ more than 1 in 10 of the world’s births and a bigger problem than previously believed, according to the first country-by-country estimates of this obstetric epidemic.

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The story of the Massachusetts father who broke his 3-year-old daughter out of her day care center after staff had left is alarming on many levels. According to the Associated Press, Keith Paquette says when he got to Westport Country Day School shortly after 5 p.m., no one was there. He says he was forced to smash a window to release his daughter Samantha Jo because the building was locked.

     <title>Tanning Booth Mom Needs Lessons on More Than Just Parenting</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to The Sideshow, New Jersey mom Patricia Krentcil says her arrest for putting her 5-year-old daughter in a tanning booth was just a misunderstanding. It's hard, however, when looking at the image of Krentcil to misunderstand her questionable act of parenting is not the only problem she has. Her need to bake herself to a burnt-toast color in a tanning bed is a problem as well.

     <title>Kids on cow farms may have fewer allergies</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Kids who grow up on farms and have contact with cows and cow milk are less likely to have allergies and asthma than kids raised nearby but not on a farm, according to a new study from Europe. Researchers had previously noticed that kids raised on European farms have lower rates of asthma and allergies than other children (see Reuters Health story of June 1, 2010). But the new findings help identify, at least in part, what specifically may protect some farm-raised youngsters against developing asthma or allergies. &quot;Nature can really teach us something here,&quot; said Dr. ...

     <description>
      ATLANTA (Reuters) - Georgia Governor Nathan Deal on Tuesday signed legislation banning most abortions after 20 weeks pregnancy, the seventh state to outlaw most late-term abortions based on controversial research that a fetus can feel pain by that stage of development. Georgia already prohibits most abortions starting in the third trimester. But lawmakers in the Republican-controlled legislature passed the measure banning most abortions after 20 weeks, or in the later weeks of the second trimester. ...

     <title>Triplets fare well as teenagers: study</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Although triplets are usually born early and smaller than other babies, they may be faring well by the time they are teenagers, a small study suggests. The study, which followed 19 sets of triplets, found that by about age 14, the teens were in the &quot;normal&quot; range as far as health-related quality of life and behavior. And they were faring no differently than 51 teenagers who were born as &quot;singletons,&quot; but also at a low weight. In fact, parents of triplets reported fewer behavioral issues compared with parents of singletons. Dr. ...

     <title>Preschooler Locked in Day Care Shows Gross Staff Negligence</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The story of the Massachusetts father who broke his 3-year-old daughter out of her day care center after staff had left is alarming on many levels. According to the Associated Press, Keith Paquette says when he got to Westport Country Day School shortly after 5 p.m., no one was there. He says he was forced to smash a window to release his daughter Samantha Jo because the building was locked.

     <title>Tanning Booth Mom Needs Lessons on More Than Just Parenting</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to The Sideshow, New Jersey mom Patricia Krentcil says her arrest for putting her 5-year-old daughter in a tanning booth was just a misunderstanding. It's hard, however, when looking at the image of Krentcil to misunderstand her questionable act of parenting is not the only problem she has. Her need to bake herself to a burnt-toast color in a tanning bed is a problem as well.

     <title>Kids on cow farms may have fewer allergies</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Kids who grow up on farms and have contact with cows and cow milk are less likely to have allergies and asthma than kids raised nearby but not on a farm, according to a new study from Europe. Researchers had previously noticed that kids raised on European farms have lower rates of asthma and allergies than other children (see Reuters Health story of June 1, 2010). But the new findings help identify, at least in part, what specifically may protect some farm-raised youngsters against developing asthma or allergies. &quot;Nature can really teach us something here,&quot; said Dr. ...
