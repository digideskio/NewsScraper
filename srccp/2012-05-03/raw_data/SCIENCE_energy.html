     <title>Delta Buys Oil Refinery -- Start of a Wider Trend?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Fuel prices are sky high and continue to rise. Just as they affect drivers at the pump, they also have a huge impact on airlines, which translates into higher ticket prices for flyers like me. Airlines burn through billions of gallons of jet fuel each year, and each increase in price directly affects their bottom line. Delta Air Lines used 3.9 billion gallons of fuel last year. That fuel cost the airline $11.8 billion, which was 36 percent of its overall operating expenses, The Associated Press reports.

      COMMENTARY | Al Armendariz, a senior EPA official, has had to fall on his own sword after using a crucifixion analogy back in 2010. While the firestorm centers on the wording, the intent is far more worrisome. While &quot;making an example&quot; of someone is not uncommon as a preventative, Armendariz's own words seem a bit more far reaching.

     <title>Delta Buys Oil Refinery -- Start of a Wider Trend?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Fuel prices are sky high and continue to rise. Just as they affect drivers at the pump, they also have a huge impact on airlines, which translates into higher ticket prices for flyers like me. Airlines burn through billions of gallons of jet fuel each year, and each increase in price directly affects their bottom line. Delta Air Lines used 3.9 billion gallons of fuel last year. That fuel cost the airline $11.8 billion, which was 36 percent of its overall operating expenses, The Associated Press reports.

     <title>Exxon: Shut pipe no impact on Baton Rouge refinery</title>
     <description>
      HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said the shut North Line Pipeline was not immediately affecting the company's 502,000 barrel per day (bpd) Baton Rouge refinery on Monday. Exxon shut the North Line on Saturday night after a pressure drop. A leak of an estimated 1,900 barrel of crude was subsequently found near Torbert, Louisiana. The Baton Rouge refinery is the nation's third-largest. (Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)

     <title>EPA's Armendariz Resigns for Revealing Crucify Comment</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Al Armendariz, a senior EPA official, has had to fall on his own sword after using a crucifixion analogy back in 2010. While the firestorm centers on the wording, the intent is far more worrisome. While &quot;making an example&quot; of someone is not uncommon as a preventative, Armendariz's own words seem a bit more far reaching.

     <title>Delta Buys Oil Refinery -- Start of a Wider Trend?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Fuel prices are sky high and continue to rise. Just as they affect drivers at the pump, they also have a huge impact on airlines, which translates into higher ticket prices for flyers like me. Airlines burn through billions of gallons of jet fuel each year, and each increase in price directly affects their bottom line. Delta Air Lines used 3.9 billion gallons of fuel last year. That fuel cost the airline $11.8 billion, which was 36 percent of its overall operating expenses, The Associated Press reports.
