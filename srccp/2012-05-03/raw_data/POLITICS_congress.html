     <description>
      Roger Ailes doesn't have any trouble getting face time with the nation's top conservative lawmakers because, conveniently, they're showing up in droves at his second floor office in the Fox News headquarters. As&nbsp;Politico's Jake Sherman and Manu Raju&nbsp;report,&nbsp;House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sen. John McCain and, yes, Mitt Romney are just a few of the Republican leaders who have paid Ailes a behind-closed-doors visit in recent weeks. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Federal officials are putting fresh pressure on Congress to take action on the National Flood Insurance Program, whose authorization expires at the end of this month, one day before hurricane season begins.

     <title>Bachmann Endorses Romney Even Though He 'Cannot Beat Obama'</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Some will say Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., was exercising her female prerogative -- that of changing her mind.

But it might well be just a little short of hypocritical, given some of her past statements.

Michael Grimm, a first-term Republican congressman from New York City and member of the House Financial Services Committee, has circulated to colleagues a proposed letter that would ask U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to step aside. The move comes roughly six months after a bankruptcy filing by MF Global, which had been run by former Democratic U.S. Senator and New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
