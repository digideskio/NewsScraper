     <title>Daniel Chong and Other Notable DEA Missteps</title>
     <description>
      News outlets have detailed in the last couple days the story of Daniel Chong, 24, an engineering student at the University of California-San Diego, who was picked up as part of a federal drug raid. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time when the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) stormed a house that netted 18,000 ecstasy pills. Of the nine taken into custody, Chong wasn't charged and was left alone in a holding cell for four days without food, water or a toilet.

     <title>Hold Your Nose and Vote for Romney</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Newt Gingrich suspending his presidential campaign was far less newsworthy than his endorsement of former political foe Mitt Romney. While the encouragement to vote for Romney during a speech televised by Fox News was not done in the most praising of terms, Gingrich made a valid point: Romney is a lot better than the other guy. The intelligent yet controversial Republican apparently shares the same sentiments as many fiscally conservative voter struggling with the idea of getting behind Romney.

     <title>Preschooler Locked in Day Care Shows Gross Staff Negligence</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The story of the Massachusetts father who broke his 3-year-old daughter out of her day care center after staff had left is alarming on many levels. According to the Associated Press, Keith Paquette says when he got to Westport Country Day School shortly after 5 p.m., no one was there. He says he was forced to smash a window to release his daughter Samantha Jo because the building was locked.

     <title>DEA's Apology for Forgetting Student Isn't Enough</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | If anyone else had placed a person in a cell and left that person there for four days without food, water or a bathroom, they'd be locked up. But when the perpetrator of such a poor example of humanitarian treatment is the Drug Enforcement Administration, one has to wonder if there will be any consequences.

     <title>Debbie Wasserman Schultz's GOP War on Women Claim is Weak</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has thrown out some wacky ideas during her term, but she completely jumped over the line of reasonability earlier this week. Wasserman Schultz accused Mitt Romney and the Republican Party of attempting to &quot;narrow&quot; the definition of rape, according to Hot Air. Her blind allegiance to President Barack Obama is counterintuitive to representing the best interests of the American people.

     <title>Planned Parenthood Should Earn Texas Lawmakers a Civil Lawsuit</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Jerry Smith, judge of the 5th Circuit Court, overturned a lower court decision and allowed Texas to withdraw funding from Planned Parenthood because the organization provides abortions, according to Reuters. This prompted me to ask: How important are Planned Parenthood's other services and how severe a transgression against the people of Texas did legislators commit if those services are important?

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | It's beginning to look like the Republicans really don't want to win the presidency in 2012. If they wanted to win, why would they have let the conservatives push out Mitt Romney's newly appointed foreign policy advisor, Richard Grenell?

     <title>Study: Texas Wind Farms Not Causing Global Warming</title>
     <description>
      A study first reported by Reuters seemed to suggest large-scale wind farms in West Texas cause localized warming of the surface. The implication was the spread of such wind farms might cause rather than alleviate global warming.

     <title>Tanning Booth Mom Needs Lessons on More Than Just Parenting</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to The Sideshow, New Jersey mom Patricia Krentcil says her arrest for putting her 5-year-old daughter in a tanning booth was just a misunderstanding. It's hard, however, when looking at the image of Krentcil to misunderstand her questionable act of parenting is not the only problem she has. Her need to bake herself to a burnt-toast color in a tanning bed is a problem as well.

     <title>Jon Stewart Knows GOP's Problem: They're on Crack</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | On Tuesday night's episode of &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; comedian Jon Stewart narrowed down all the reasons why conservatives seem to be having a problem with President Obama politicizing the killing of Osama bin Laden to three things: selective recall, the fact that they can't take credit for it, and that Republicans are on crack.

     <title>Mitt Romney Blasts Democrats -- But He's Missing Something</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Speaking at a campaign even in Chantilly, Va., Mitt Romney was reported by the Los Angeles Times as saying President Barack Obama has in his 3 1/2 years as president attacked success, separated classes of people and seeks scapegoats to excuse his own failures. While it might be true President Obama has added to the overall burden for business owners, Republicans have done the same in times past.

     <title>Two Decades After Discovery, Otzi the Iceman’s Story Continues</title>
     <description>
      LiveScience.com reports Otzi the Iceman, a well-preserved mummy found in the Italian Alps in 1991, has a new story to tell. A special microscope was able to sense the miniscule shape of red blood cells near a wound in the mummy. Researchers have attempted to identify blood on stone tools from the past but were unsuccessful. These red blood cells are the oldest to ever be discovered.

     <title>Target is Sending Amazon a Message by Removing the Kindle Family</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Associated Press reports retailing giant Target has dropped Amazon's Kindle series from its website and stores. The move probably has a little to do with Target's decision to expand its selection of Apple products, which underlines the retailer's pop culture dedication. While this could be a move Target could come to regret, it makes perfect sense.

     <title>Gingrich Proves Why Political Parties Need to Regulate Campaign Debt</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Newt Gingrich left the Republican race today with over $4 million in debt, according to Good Morning America. As a political/business consultant, I have always believed political parties should have limits on the amount of debt candidates should be allowed to hold during elections. It ends up making the political parties look bad when candidates are able to amass large amounts of debt which can do harm to small businesses.

     <title>Farewell, 'Bucket List' Baby Avery and Thank You</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Five-month-old Avery Lynn Canahuati, nicknamed the &quot;bucket list baby,&quot; died from complications of spinal muscular atrophy on Monday, the New York Daily News reports. When Avery's parents Mike and Laura Canahuati were told their daughter didn't have long to live, they decided to make the most of the time they had and to spread awareness about SMA. I love their positive, proactive, pay-it-forward spirit.

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Korean community in Los Angeles was hit hard by the Los Angeles riots. Many lost businesses they had worked lives to build. Korean residents have a name for the events that unfolded in April of 1992, Sa I Gu. Literally translated, it means 4-2-9, the date the riots began. Why did this group of people suffer so heavily in the riots?

     <title>Are Liberals Just Scared of a Vice President Paul Ryan?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | It seems everyone is taking sides on the issue of whether Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan would be a good vice-presidential candidate for Mitt Romney. Ryan, who also serves as the powerful chairman of the House Budget Committee, is an expert on the federal budget and has proposed some head-turning ideas toward reining in federal spending. There's nothing wrong with that.

     <title>Republicans Simply Do Not Believe Women Paid Less Than Men</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Somewhere in all the political rhetoric and posturing, an inkling of what might be a fundamental truth might glimmer but never take hold in one's conscious mind. Sometimes, though, it bursts through like a runaway train. Such was undoubtedly the epiphany experienced by MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow when she discovered that the reason Republicans have no interest in fixing the wage gap between women and men or keeping in place -- or enacting -- laws to protect against gender payroll discrimination is due to the fact that most Republicans do not believe that such a gap exists.

     <title>Gingrich Calls it Quits on the Presidency, but Not His Fight</title>
     <description>
      Newt Gingrich officially pulled the plug on his campaign for the presidency on Wednesday, although he appeared to stop short of fully endorsing GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney as had been expected. Gingrich said that he and his wife Callista plan to continue to campaign for Republican leadership on all levels of government throughout the rest of the year, from local to federal.

     <title>Bachmann Endorses Romney Even Though He 'Cannot Beat Obama'</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Some will say Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., was exercising her female prerogative -- that of changing her mind. As sexist and condescending as that might sound (and is), there will be others who will simply count it as accepting the inevitable. But it might well be just a little short of hypocritical, given some of her past statements.

     <title>Republicans, Pundits Ridicule Obama's New Campaign Slogan</title>
     <description>
      The Obama campaign unveiled its slogan for the 2012 elections this week. The slogan is simple, just one-word will set the tone for the campaign. That word is &quot;Forward,&quot; and it is being mocked by the GOP. The ridicule is coming from Republican leaders, pundits, and even Mitt Romney himself. Here is a look at some of the things being said about the new campaign slogan.

     <title>Illinois Legislative Scholarship Program Nears End with Senate Vote</title>
     <description>
      According to the Chicago Sun-Times, in a 43-5 vote, the Illinois Senate approved a bill on Thursday that seeks to eliminate the legislative scholarship program. The program, which was established back in 1909, has been under fire for years due to several incidents of abuse and political favors. Additionally, more lawmakers, including high-profile politicians like Gov. Pat Quinn and Illinois Senate President John Cullerton, have continued to back the abolition of it.

     <title>Houston Family Locked in Restaurant Should Know Better</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY| Every now and then it seems like the mandatory gratuity charge on restaurant bills creeps into headlines. KPRC Houston is now reporting the fate of one recent dinning party that refused to pay a 17 percent mandatory gratuity due to lousy service. According to the report, restaurant staff locked the doors and called police. Of course, the report concludes that party paid the tip to avoid any future problems. Apparently some folks in the service industry have forgotten that once a charge is mandatory it becomes less generous.

     <description>
      COMMENTARY | We here in America call our nation the &quot;land of the free and the home of the brave,&quot; at least in our national anthem. It seems, thus, that those rare sorts with real guts like Chen Guangcheng of China could serve as an example to everyone of us.

     <title>Houston Family Learns the Customer Isn't Always Right</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | When Jasmine Marks and family went out to eat at the La Fisherman Restaurant on Highway 6 in west Houston, she felt the service wasn't satisfactory. And, according to a report from MSNBC, rather than telling the manager, she contested the gratuity added to her bill for parties of five or more -- a policy clearly printed at the bottom of the restaurant's menu -- and found herself in hot water quick.

     <title>Fate of Pennsylvania Casino License in Question</title>
     <description>
      Pennsylvania has the second highest gaming revenue in America, according to the Associated Press. The Keystone State managed to achieve that mark with just 11 of the legally allowed 14 casinos, but that number of allowed casinos could change to 13, as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. The paper highlights the 2004 law that permits Pennsylvania to have seven horse track casinos, five stand-alone casinos, and two resort type casinos. Two stand-alone casinos were supposed to build in the Philadelphia area, but now lawmakers are starting to waver on fifth gambling establishment in that area.

     <title>Ashton Kuctcher in Brownface: Why Popchips Ad Isn't OK</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Popchips recently pulled its ad featuring Ashton Kutcher as a sort-of spoof of a Bollywood actor in response to claims of racism. In the ad, Kutcher dons brown make-up, a fake &quot;Indian&quot; accent, and, in what might be the worst of the get-up, a prosthetic nose and fake moustache. He prances. He sits cross-legged.

     <title>Mitt Romney Replaces His Etch a Sketch</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | It may seem a small accomplishment compared to the $10.65 billion profit Google reported for the first quarter last week, but Thursday's news from General Motors was anything but small. The reborn automaker announced a profit of $1 billion. GM's earnings surprised analysts. They likely did not surprise Mitt Romney.

     <title>“National Day of Prayer” is Obama’s Purely Political Move that Divides the Country by Excluding Secular Minority</title>

      COMMENTARY | It is inevitable that a religiously charged and nationally endorsed observance called the &quot;National Day of Prayer&quot; will stir up the ire and reproach of secularists in America, but I contend that a simple name change would solve all that. President Obama, in his proclamation of May 3 as a day dedicated nationally, tells us to count our blessings and be aware of the sacrifices made by others who fought for the freedoms we enjoy. ...

     <title>In Kelly Ayotte, Mitt Romney’s Veepstakes Tour Continues</title>
     <description>
      Until Mitt Romney is officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention in late August, there is important business at hand. ABC News reports Romney made a campaign stop in New Hampshire on a fishing trip with Sen. Kelly Ayotte. The May 1 visit was speculated by some to help ascertain her credentials as a possible vice presidential running mate, according to ABC News.

     <title>Predjudice and Discrimination in North Carolina's Amendment One Vote</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | North Carolina's controversial Amendment One vote is just under a week away. The amendment states that &quot;Marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state&quot; and is very discriminatory against homosexuals. Now comes even more news that shows the bigotry and hatred behind the proposed state constitutional amendment. A Baptist church pastor, Sean Harris, preached in a sermon on Sunday in Fayetteville, N.C., that if you see your son &quot;dropping the limp wrist, you walk over there and crack that wrist. ...

     <title>Republicans Simply Do Not Believe Women Paid Less Than Men</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Somewhere in all the political rhetoric and posturing, an inkling of what might be a fundamental truth might glimmer but never take hold in one's conscious mind. Sometimes, though, it bursts through like a runaway train. Such was undoubtedly the epiphany experienced by MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow when she discovered that the reason Republicans have no interest in fixing the wage gap between women and men or keeping in place -- or enacting -- laws to protect against gender payroll discrimination is due to the fact that most Republicans do not believe that such a gap exists.

     <title>Gingrich Calls it Quits on the Presidency, but Not His Fight</title>
     <description>
      Newt Gingrich officially pulled the plug on his campaign for the presidency on Wednesday, although he appeared to stop short of fully endorsing GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney as had been expected. Gingrich said that he and his wife Callista plan to continue to campaign for Republican leadership on all levels of government throughout the rest of the year, from local to federal.

     <title>Bachmann Endorses Romney Even Though He 'Cannot Beat Obama'</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Some will say Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., was exercising her female prerogative -- that of changing her mind. As sexist and condescending as that might sound (and is), there will be others who will simply count it as accepting the inevitable. But it might well be just a little short of hypocritical, given some of her past statements.

     <title>Republicans, Pundits Ridicule Obama's New Campaign Slogan</title>
     <description>
      The Obama campaign unveiled its slogan for the 2012 elections this week. The slogan is simple, just one-word will set the tone for the campaign. That word is &quot;Forward,&quot; and it is being mocked by the GOP. The ridicule is coming from Republican leaders, pundits, and even Mitt Romney himself. Here is a look at some of the things being said about the new campaign slogan.

     <title>Houston Family Locked in Restaurant Should Know Better</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY| Every now and then it seems like the mandatory gratuity charge on restaurant bills creeps into headlines. KPRC Houston is now reporting the fate of one recent dinning party that refused to pay a 17 percent mandatory gratuity due to lousy service. According to the report, restaurant staff locked the doors and called police. Of course, the report concludes that party paid the tip to avoid any future problems. Apparently some folks in the service industry have forgotten that once a charge is mandatory it becomes less generous.

     <title>Illinois Legislative Scholarship Program Nears End with Senate Vote</title>
     <description>
      According to the Chicago Sun-Times, in a 43-5 vote, the Illinois Senate approved a bill on Thursday that seeks to eliminate the legislative scholarship program. The program, which was established back in 1909, has been under fire for years due to several incidents of abuse and political favors. Additionally, more lawmakers, including high-profile politicians like Gov. Pat Quinn and Illinois Senate President John Cullerton, have continued to back the abolition of it.

And, according to a report from MSNBC, rather than telling the manager, she contested the gratuity added to her bill for parties of five or more -- a policy clearly printed at the bottom of the restaurant's menu -- and found herself in hot water quick.

     <title>Fate of Pennsylvania Casino License in Question</title>
     <description>
      Pennsylvania has the second highest gaming revenue in America, according to the Associated Press. The Keystone State managed to achieve that mark with just 11 of the legally allowed 14 casinos, but that number of allowed casinos could change to 13, as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. The paper highlights the 2004 law that permits Pennsylvania to have seven horse track casinos, five stand-alone casinos, and two resort type casinos. Two stand-alone casinos were supposed to build in the Philadelphia area, but now lawmakers are starting to waver on fifth gambling establishment in that area.

     <title>Ashton Kuctcher in Brownface: Why Popchips Ad Isn't OK</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Popchips recently pulled its ad featuring Ashton Kutcher as a sort-of spoof of a Bollywood actor in response to claims of racism. In the ad, Kutcher dons brown make-up, a fake &quot;Indian&quot; accent, and, in what might be the worst of the get-up, a prosthetic nose and fake moustache. He prances. He sits cross-legged.

     <title>Mitt Romney Replaces His Etch a Sketch</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | It may seem a small accomplishment compared to the $10.65 billion profit Google reported for the first quarter last week, but Thursday's news from General Motors was anything but small. The reborn automaker announced a profit of $1 billion. GM's earnings surprised analysts. They likely did not surprise Mitt Romney.

     <title>“National Day of Prayer” is Obama’s Purely Political Move that Divides the Country by Excluding Secular Minority</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | It is inevitable that a religiously charged and nationally endorsed observance called the &quot;National Day of Prayer&quot; will stir up the ire and reproach of secularists in America, but I contend that a simple name change would solve all that. President Obama, in his proclamation of May 3 as a day dedicated nationally, tells us to count our blessings and be aware of the sacrifices made by others who fought for the freedoms we enjoy. ...
