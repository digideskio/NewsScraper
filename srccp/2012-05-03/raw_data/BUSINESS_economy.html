Brent crude futures dropped below their 100-day moving average on Thursday for the first time since January, while U.S. crude fell by $2 during the session.

     <description>
      DUBLIN (Reuters) - German business software group SAP AG will hire 250 more people at its Irish operations, the company said on Thursday, in the latest boost to an economy which has one of the worst jobless rates in Europe. Irish unemployment has stayed above 14 percent for almost two years and is forecast to fall to just 11.7 percent by 2015 even though employment rose for the first time in four years in the final quarter of last year. ...

     <title>Greeks to vent rage in weekend election</title>
     <description>
      ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek voters enraged by economic hardship will punish traditional parties in a highly uncertain election on Sunday that could plunge the country into new political chaos and shake the entire euro zone. At stake is whether Greece sticks with the harsh terms of a hugely unpopular 130 billion euro ($170.83 billion) EU/IMF bailout, or heads down a path that could see it ejected from the single currency, with dire risks for other EU peripheral states like Spain and Italy. Wages and benefits have been slashed, unemployment has rocketed and thousands of businesses have collapsed. ...

     <description>
      JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's rand may remain trapped in ranges in coming months but should appreciate modestly against the dollar by early next year on higher interest rates and an improving global economy, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday. A survey of more than 30 currency strategists and economists expect the rand, which is highly sensitive to global sentiment on risk to hold steady against the dollar in the next six months, firming to 7.65 by the end of April next year. The rand is currently trading at around 7.73 per dollar. ...

     <title>S.Africa's rand holds firm, bonds edge higher</title>
     <description>
      JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's rand held firm against the dollar on Thursday and government bonds ticked up in early trade although the debt market's gains might not be sustained in the long-term as traders price in higher interest rates next year. The rand was at 7.72 to the dollar by 0655 GMT, up 0.1 percent from Wednesday's close at 7.7275 and within sight of the previous day's four-week high of 7.707. But the currency remains vulnerable to a gloomy economic outlook for Europe. ...

     <title>Gold under pressure from weak data; ECB eyed</title>
     <description>
      SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Gold was under pressure on Thursday after disappointing data from both sides of the Atlantic fueled concerns about global growth, while investors awaited a rate decision by the European Central Bank later in the day for more trading cues. The dollar strengthened slightly against a basket of currencies, as worries about a faltering euro zone economy offset concerns over a slower momentum in the U.S. recovery. A stronger greenback weighs on dollar-priced commodities including gold. ...

     <title>Dow, S&amp;P 500 fall as private-sector hiring spurs worry</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow edged lower on Wednesday as data showed that private sector hiring fell far more than expected in April, sparking concerns that Friday's U.S. jobs report will also disappoint investors. Private employers added 119,000 jobs in April, well short of the 177,000 expected, the ADP report showed. That sparked market rumors that Friday's payrolls data will show the economy added just 125,000 to 150,000 jobs last month, well below a Reuters consensus forecast of 170,000. ...

Markets faltered after data showed tepid growth in the U.S. services sector. Stocks turned lower, government debt pared losses and the U.S. dollar trimmed gains against the yen after the Institute for Supply Management said its services sector index fell to 53.5 in April from 56.0 in March. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Fed's Williams, Lockhart, Plosser say no to QE3</title>
     <description>
      SANTA BARBARA, California (Reuters) - Three top U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Thursday said they would not favor more monetary policy easing unless economic conditions took a turn for the worse. The jobless rate, which has come down sharply in recent months, would need to be stuck at above 8 percent, &quot;not just for a few months&quot; to require a third round of quantitative easing, known as QE3, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said. ...

     <description>
      SANTA BARBARA, California (Reuters) - A third round of U.S. monetary stimulus cannot be ruled out, but should only be used if economic conditions get considerably worse, Federal Reserve officials said on Thursday. More easing is &quot;a real option, but an option to be held in reserve for more serious circumstances than we now face,&quot; Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said. San Francisco Fed President John Williams agreed. &quot;Our policy is correctly calibrated,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not in favor of going to QE3 right now.&quot; Williams added that he could support more easing should the U.S. ...

     <title>U.S. auto sales to drive aluminum demand -Novelis</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Novelis Inc. , the world's largest maker of aluminum sheet, said strong U.S. automotive sales this year would help drive U.S. demand for products using aluminum at a pace consistent with an expected 2 percent growth in U.S. gross domestic product. &quot;We look at the U.S. economy, all things considered, as stable and running at about a 2 percent GDP, maybe 2.5 percent. Nothing exciting, but still growing,&quot; Chief Executive Phil Martens told Reuters in a recent interview. ...

     <title>Egypt's c.bank keeps key interest rates steady</title>
     <description>
      CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's central bank kept its benchmark overnight deposit and lending rates steady on Thursday, warning that although economic growth was feeble, there was a risk that inflation might accelerate. The bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) left its lending rate unchanged at 10.25 percent and the deposit rate at 9.25 percent after its regular meeting, it said on its website. Gross domestic product grew by only 0.3 percent in the final quarter of 2011 after similarly weak second and third quarters and a 4. ...

Employers likely added 170,000 workers to their payrolls last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, up from March's meager print of 120,000. That would allay fears the economy is losing momentum.

     <title>Stimulus best medicine for UK, says BoE's Bean - FT</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - A highly stimulatory monetary stance is the &quot;the best medicine&quot; to help rebalance Britain's economy, Bank of England deputy governor Charles Bean said in an opinion piece in the Financial Times on Friday. Bean defended the bank's stimulatory policy stance, which has come under renewed criticism as Britain slid into its second recession since the financial crisis. &quot;The present highly stimulatory policy stance means activity, employment and asset prices are all higher than they would otherwise be,&quot; said Bean. ...
