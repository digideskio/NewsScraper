     <title>Oklahoma says running out of death penalty drug</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Oklahoma, which executes more prisoners per capita than any other state, said on Wednesday it has only one remaining dose of pentobarbital, a key drug used to kill condemned prisoners. One reason the state is running out is because of a ban on the sale of drugs for such purposes by the European Union, which opposes the death penalty. Oklahoma has a single vial of pentobarbital left after the execution on Tuesday night of 57-year-old Michael B. Selsor, prison spokesman Jerry Massie said. ...

      DENVER (Reuters) - An 18-year-old Colorado woman who survived a fiery crash in her sport utility vehicle told authorities she lost control and struck a tree after being distracted by fluttering moths, police said on Wednesday. The woman, who was not identified by authorities, was driving her GMC Denali in Colorado Springs on Tuesday when she veered off the road and crashed, according to a police blotter entry. As gasoline poured from a ruptured fuel line, passing motorists pulled her out of the driver's side window before the car burst into flames. ...

     <title>Clock ticks on Koch case over fake Jefferson wine</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The clock could be running out for billionaire William I. Koch in a lawsuit against Christie's in which he accused the auction house of fraud over his purchase of wines said to have been owned by third American president Thomas Jefferson. A federal appeals court panel in New York on Wednesday questioned whether Koch had conducted timely due diligence when doubts were raised about four bottles of 1787 wine engraved &quot;Th.J&quot; that were sold to him in 1987 and 1988 by dealer Hardy Rodenstock through intermediaries. In March last year, U.S. ...

      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The California mother of octuplets, dubbed &quot;Octomom,&quot; filed for bankruptcy on Monday, after previously admitting she was on public assistance to support herself and her 14 children.

But goodwill turned to anger in the media after it was revealed Suleman had undergone fertility treatments when she already had six children, and questions were raised about her ability to provide for her family. Her children became only the second set of octuplets known to have survived birth in the United States. ...

      ORLANDO (Reuters) - Some bomb-sniffing dogs trained to help fight terrorism are turning their olfactory attention toward a different scourge: Burmese pythons in Florida's Everglades National Park. The dogs are members of &quot;EcoDogs,&quot; a three-year-old collaboration at Alabama's Auburn University between the science departments and the school's Canine Detection Research Institute, which trains dogs to detect explosives. &quot;The dogs are really, really good,&quot; said Christina Romagosa, a biologist at Auburn.

     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Oklahoma, which executes more prisoners per capita than any other state, said on Wednesday it has only one remaining dose of pentobarbital, a key drug used to kill condemned prisoners. One reason the state is running out is because of a ban on the sale of drugs for such purposes by the European Union, which opposes the death penalty. Oklahoma has a single vial of pentobarbital left after the execution on Tuesday night of 57-year-old Michael B. Selsor, prison spokesman Jerry Massie said. ...

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The clock could be running out for billionaire William I. Koch in a lawsuit against Christie's in which he accused the auction house of fraud over his purchase of wines said to have been owned by third American president Thomas Jefferson. A federal appeals court panel in New York on Wednesday questioned whether Koch had conducted timely due diligence when doubts were raised about four bottles of 1787 wine engraved &quot;Th.J&quot; that were sold to him in 1987 and 1988 by dealer Hardy Rodenstock through intermediaries. In March last year, U.S. ...

      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The California mother of octuplets, dubbed &quot;Octomom,&quot; filed for bankruptcy on Monday, after previously admitting she was on public assistance to support herself and her 14 children. Nadya Suleman, 36, gave birth to eight babies as a single mother in 2009. But goodwill turned to anger in the media after it was revealed Suleman had undergone fertility treatments when she already had six children, and questions were raised about her ability to provide for her family. Her children became only the second set of octuplets known to have survived birth in the United States. ...

     <title>Court rejects appeal in wife's attempt to poison mistress</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - A microbiologist charged under an anti-terrorism law for attempting to poison her husband's mistress lost a bid to overturn her conviction on Thursday. Carol Anne Bond had argued that the U.S. federal chemical weapons act, which makes it a crime to acquire or use any chemical weapon, was meant to target terrorist activity, not the crimes of a spurned lover. A Philadelphia-based federal court rejected Bond's appeal, ruling that the government was justified in applying the law, even if it seemed a questionable move. ...

     <title>Researcher believed killed by lab bacteria</title>

      FAIRFAX, California (Reuters) - A young research associate killed by a highly virulent strain of meningococcal disease is believed to have contracted the bacteria from the San Francisco lab where he was working on a vaccine against it, public health officials said on Thursday. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention experts are seeking to confirm what they already suspect: that Richard Din, 25, died Saturday in an unusual case of a scientist being fatally infected with an agent from his own laboratory. ...

     <title>Snake blamed for Oklahoma City power outage</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - A snake that crawled into an electrical substation on Thursday knocked out power to nearly 14,000 homes on the northwest side of Oklahoma's state capital, utility officials said. The power failure occurred at about 2 a.m. (7 a.m. British time) when the snake touched a component that caused a switch to trip, Oklahoma Gas and Electric spokeswoman Karen Kurtz said, adding that the snake was evidently seeking shelter after heavy rains. At the scene of the crime, no one could determine exactly what kind of serpent caused all the trouble. ...

     <description>
      A French American scientist has invented a new alcohol spray that instantly intoxicates the user. However, the effects are nearly as brief, wearing off in a matter of moments.

     <title>Oklahoma says running out of death penalty drug</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Oklahoma, which executes more prisoners per capita than any other state, said on Wednesday it has only one remaining dose of pentobarbital, a key drug used to kill condemned prisoners. One reason the state is running out is because of a ban on the sale of drugs for such purposes by the European Union, which opposes the death penalty. Oklahoma has a single vial of pentobarbital left after the execution on Tuesday night of 57-year-old Michael B. Selsor, prison spokesman Jerry Massie said. ...

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The clock could be running out for billionaire William I. Koch in a lawsuit against Christie's in which he accused the auction house of fraud over his purchase of wines said to have been owned by third American president Thomas Jefferson. A federal appeals court panel in New York on Wednesday questioned whether Koch had conducted timely due diligence when doubts were raised about four bottles of 1787 wine engraved &quot;Th.J&quot; that were sold to him in 1987 and 1988 by dealer Hardy Rodenstock through intermediaries. In March last year, U.S. ...
