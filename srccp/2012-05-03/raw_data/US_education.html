     <title>Obama Courts Young Voters with Student Loan Battle</title>
     <description>
      President Barack Obama is attempting to win favor with younger voters by championing the affordability of higher education, according to the Associated Press. Obama focused on the issue of student loans during his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday. He asked Congress to extend a law that will keep rates for one of the federal student loan programs at its current low for the time being. Without the extension, many federal student loan rates are set to double after July 1.

     <title>Striking new tone, Chris Christie says education reform is led by GOP</title>
     <description>

      KANSAS CITY, Missouri (Reuters) - A Missouri state lawmaker who is not running for reelection announced on Wednesday that he is gay, the first state-level Republican politician in the nation currently in office to do so, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund.

     <title>10 High-Profile People Whose Degrees Were Revoked</title>
     <description>
      Although college and graduate school alumni may assume their diplomas are set in stone, there's no such thing as &quot;no backsies&quot; when it comes to college conferrals, as Joel McHale's character on the television show Community knows.

     <title>Obama Courts Young Voters with Student Loan Battle</title>
     <description>
      President Barack Obama is attempting to win favor with younger voters by championing the affordability of higher education, according to the Associated Press. Obama focused on the issue of student loans during his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday. He asked Congress to extend a law that will keep rates for one of the federal student loan programs at its current low for the time being. Without the extension, many federal student loan rates are set to double after July 1.

Now, Bleiler is suing Holy Cross, arguing the college’s policies on consent and sexual misconduct discriminate against male students - violating his Title IX rights.

      KANSAS CITY, Missouri (Reuters) - A Missouri state lawmaker who is not running for reelection announced on Wednesday that he is gay, the first state-level Republican politician in the nation currently in office to do so, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. Missouri state Representative Zachary Wyatt, 27, announced his sexual orientation in a news conference at the Missouri state Capitol in Jefferson City.

     <title>Why Retirement Saving Trumps College Tuition</title>
     <description>

     <title>Jobless Graduates Show Need for Change in Higher Education</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | As if we all didn't already know that getting a college degree just isn't what it used to be, recent analysis by the Associated Press of government data proves it.

     <title>3 Tips for Teachers to Help Students Finish School Year Strong</title>

     <title>Obama Courts Young Voters with Student Loan Battle</title>
     <description>
      President Barack Obama is attempting to win favor with younger voters by championing the affordability of higher education, according to the Associated Press. Obama focused on the issue of student loans during his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday. He asked Congress to extend a law that will keep rates for one of the federal student loan programs at its current low for the time being. Without the extension, many federal student loan rates are set to double after July 1.
