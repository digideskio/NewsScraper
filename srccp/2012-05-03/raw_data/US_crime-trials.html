     <title>9/11 plot suspects head back to court at Guantanamo</title>
     <description>
      MIAMI (Reuters) - The last time Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was in the top-security courtroom at the Guantanamo Bay naval base more than three years ago, the admitted architect of the September 11 attacks was trying to confess, plead guilty and achieve martyrdom. Before the judge could determine whether the murky rules allowed defendants to plead guilty and be executed, something that is not allowed in regular U.S. courts-martial, President Barack Obama pulled the plug on the Guantanamo tribunals. ...

     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Hackers attacked the website of Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA), a spokesman said on Thursday, the latest in a wave of assaults against high profile targets like NASA, the Vatican and multi-national companies. The national police agency, often described as the British FBI, said it closed the website late on Wednesday after it came under attack from an unknown source. Internet activist groups such as Anonymous, LulzSec and Antisec have previously been linked to attacks against bodies including the U.S. Senate, Sony and Visa. ...

     <title>Kuwait close to death penalty law for blasphemy</title>
     <description>
      KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwaiti lawmakers endorsed a legal amendment on Thursday which could make insulting God and the Prophet Mohammad by Muslims punishable by death, in a second reading that brings the proposal a step closer to passing. The plan still needs approval by Kuwait's ruler before it becomes law and follows a high-profile case of suspected blasphemy on Twitter which caused an uproar in the Gulf state. The draft now includes a new clause which will mean the death penalty will only be applied if the person stands by their actions when questioned by a judge. ...

An Iraqi court was set to begin trying the country's fugitive Sunni vice president Thursday on accusations of terrorism that have touched off a political crisis and could deepen the nation's sectarian divide. Tariq al-Hashemi, the nation's highest-ranking Sunni politician, was not expected to be in court to face charges that he ran death squads that targeted government officials, security forces and Shiite pilgrims. (AP Photo/Karim Kadim, File)&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The terror trial of Iraq's fugitive Sunni vice president was postponed Thursday as his lawyers appealed to have parliament create a special court to hear the case that has touched off a political crisis and could deepen the nation's sectarian divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Oklahoma, which executes more prisoners per capita than any other state, said on Wednesday it has only one remaining dose of pentobarbital, a key drug used to kill condemned prisoners. One reason the state is running out is because of a ban on the sale of drugs for such purposes by the European Union, which opposes the death penalty. Oklahoma has a single vial of pentobarbital left after the execution on Tuesday night of 57-year-old Michael B. Selsor, prison spokesman Jerry Massie said. ...
