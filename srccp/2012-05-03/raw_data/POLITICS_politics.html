     <title>Canada Competition Bureau says OSC rules may allay TMX concerns</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's Competition Bureau signaled on Thursday that its concerns over Maple Group's C$3.8 billion ($3.84 billion) takeover bid for Toronto Stock Exchange operator TMX Group may be allayed by the Ontario Securities Commission's (OSC's) draft rules for allowing the deal to go ahead. &quot;It is possible that the OSC's recognition orders could materially change the regulatory environment such that, if enforced, our serious concerns may be substantially mitigated,&quot; bureau spokeswoman Gabrielle Tasse said after the OSC published its proposed orders, or draft rules. ...

     <title>Saleh relative quits Yemen army, fighting flares</title>
     <description>
      SANAA (Reuters) - A nephew of former Yemeni leader Ali Abdullah Saleh has resigned from his post as commander of an elite military unit, officials said on Thursday, part of a drive by the country's new U.S.-allied government to unite its army in order to fight al Qaeda. U.N. envoy Jamal Benomar told Reuters that Tariq Saleh, who earlier headed the Presidential Guard, had relinquished his new post as head of the 3rd Republican Guard brigade. The unit is one of the strongest and best-equipped brigades in the military and overlooks the capital Sanaa. ...

     <title>9/11 plot suspects head back to court at Guantanamo</title>
     <description>
      MIAMI (Reuters) - The last time Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was in the top-security courtroom at the Guantanamo Bay naval base more than three years ago, the admitted architect of the September 11 attacks was trying to confess, plead guilty and achieve martyrdom. Before the judge could determine whether the murky rules allowed defendants to plead guilty and be executed, something that is not allowed in regular U.S. courts-martial, President Barack Obama pulled the plug on the Guantanamo tribunals. ...

     <description>
      EGIO, Greece (Reuters) - Few took notice when Greek lawyer Fotis Kouvelis gathered supporters at an Athens hotel to set up his own leftist party two years ago. Today, the grey-haired leftist is much harder to ignore. With a pro-euro and anti-austerity message, Kouvelis's small Democratic Left party has quickly snapped up disgruntled Socialist voters to become one of four groups battling for third place when Greece votes in a general election on Sunday. ...

     <description>
      LESKOVAC, Serbia (Reuters) - The Zele Velkovic factory in Leskovac, once famous for its thriving textile industry, was one of the city's biggest when Yugoslavia started to implode in 1991. The next two decades brought a slow decline fueled by chronic mismanagement and a dramatic loss of competitiveness. Where more than 600 worked, now just 70 walk the factory's cavernous halls, the deafening hammering of its old industrial looms barely disguising the emptiness. ...

     <title>Kuwait close to death penalty law for blasphemy</title>
     <description>
      KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwaiti lawmakers endorsed a legal amendment on Thursday which could make insulting God and the Prophet Mohammad by Muslims punishable by death, in a second reading that brings the proposal a step closer to passing. The plan still needs approval by Kuwait's ruler before it becomes law and follows a high-profile case of suspected blasphemy on Twitter which caused an uproar in the Gulf state. The draft now includes a new clause which will mean the death penalty will only be applied if the person stands by their actions when questioned by a judge. ...

     <description>
      EDINBURG, Texas (Reuters) - Two men face immigrant harboring charges after authorities found 115 undocumented people inside three small South Texas houses, some of whom did not have access to food or water for days, according to federal court records published on Thursday. Police responded to an emergency call on Wednesday from an illegal immigrant inside one of the stash houses. The home was bound with padlocks and chains from the outside, with bars covering the windows, said Oscar Trevino, a police spokesman in Edinburg, about 15 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. ...

     <description>
      GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands (Reuters) - A diplomatic spat in the normally tranquil Cayman Islands has put the ruling party and the British government at loggerheads after the locally elected premier accused London of conspiring with opposition politicians to &quot;ruin this country.&quot; Premier McKeeva Bush accused British officials, including the British-appointed governor and police commissioner, of conducting baseless investigations into his handling of government contracts. He described the investigations on local television as &quot;nothing more than fishing expeditions. ...

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Health officials said the number of new shortages of crucial drugs used to treat cancer and other illnesses had been halved compared to a year ago, and attributed the improvement to earlier notice from drugmakers about looming supply issues. There have been 42 newly scarce drugs so far this year, compared to 90 in the same period a year ago, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said on Thursday on the agency's website. Efforts to combat shortages escalated last year when 250 medicines were in short supply, up from 56 in 2006. ...

     <title>Suicide bomber kills 15 in northwest Pakistan</title>
     <description>
      KHAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 15 people and wounded 40 on Friday in an attack on a police checkpoint in northwest Pakistan, casting doubt on official assertions that security offensives have weakened militants. The bomber struck near a crowded market in Bajaur, one of the unruly Pashtun tribal regions near the Afghan border where the military has mounted offensives in recent years against the al Qaeda-linked Pakistani Taliban, the biggest security threat to the country. ...

     <title>China paper calls Chen a U.S. pawn; envoy is a &quot;troublemaker&quot;</title>
     <description>
      BEIJING (Reuters) - One of China's main official newspapers accused blind dissident Chen Guangcheng on Friday of serving as a &quot;tool&quot; for American subversion of Communist Party power and called the U.S. ambassador a backpack-wearing, Starbucks-sipping troublemaker. The commentary in the Beijing Daily was the strongest Chinese state media condemnation yet of the U.S. administration in a standoff over Chen, who sought protection in the U.S. embassy in Beijing, then left, and has now said he regrets that choice and wants exile in the United States. ...

     <title>China's yuan is at equilibrium level: People's Daily</title>
     <description>
      BEIJING (Reuters) - China's yuan is at an equilibrium against the dollar and even high in some respects, the country's main official newspaper said on Friday in remarks that could sow further tension in talks between Beijing and Washington. The People's Daily, the mouthpiece newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, said differences in labor productivity and operating costs in the world's two biggest economies show the yuan, or the renminbi, is reasonably valued versus the dollar. The article came just a day after U.S. ...

     <title>Nepal PM to set up unity government after cabinet quits</title>
     <description>
      KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal's prime minister worked on Friday to form a coalition government that will include the main opposition parties after his cabinet quit as part of a negotiated effort to quell political tumult in the desperately poor Himalayan state. Nepal, wedged between its giant neighbours China and India, has been plagued by instability for years even though a Maoist insurgency ended in 2006 and the monarchy was abolished, as the rebels had demanded, two years later. ...

      PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian lawmakers approved the nomination of a close adviser to President Michel Martelly as prime minister on Thursday, raising hopes of ending a political stalemate that has stalled reconstruction efforts after Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake. The lower house of parliament voted 62-3, with two abstentions, to approve Martelly's nomination of Laurent Lamothe, currently Haiti's foreign minister. Lamothe, a 39-year-old former businessman and close friend of Martelly, was approved by Haiti's Senate last month. ...

A survey by pollster BVA showed Hollande taking 52.5 percent of the vote in Sunday's final round of the presidential election, down two points from late April, with Sarkozy taking 47.5 percent, a rise of two points. Separately, TNS-Sofres showed Hollande's score edging down 1.5 points to 53.5 percent from last week, with Sarkozy rising to 46. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
