The parent of MTV and Nickelodeon benefited mainly from an increase in affiliate fee revenue from cable and satellite distributors. This helped offset relatively flat advertising revenue growth in a quarter that has been dominated by concerns of weak viewer ratings at the company's flagship children's network, Nickelodeon, and also at MTV. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 27,000, the biggest weekly drop since May 2011. The report ran counter to data indicating weaker private sector hiring that pushed stocks lower Wednesday. But a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed the pace of growth in the U.S. services sector slowed more than expected in April and new orders dropped. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Cigna is the latest health insurer to miss Wall Street's earnings target in the period, following Aetna Inc , Coventry Health Care and Humana Inc . Cigna did raise its full-year earnings forecast. Net income fell to $371 million, or $1.28 per share, from $413 million, or $1.51 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Cigna's earnings of $1. ...

     <title>European shares rise as earnings reassure</title>
     <description>
      PARIS (Reuters) - European stocks rose early on Thursday after results from bellwethers Societe Generale and France Telecom reassured investors, but a sharp rise in Spain's borrowing costs at a bond auction dampened the mood. Shares in Societe Generale climbed 2.8 percent after a surprise surge in the French bank's trading revenues from its bond, currency and commodity desks helped soothe the effect of a series of one-off charges. Other banks gained ground, with French investment bank Natixis up 1.6 percent, Spain's Bankinter up 1.5 percent and Italian lender Intesa SanPaolo up 0.9 percent. ...

     <title>Dow, S&amp;P 500 fall as private-sector hiring spurs worry</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow edged lower on Wednesday as data showed that private sector hiring fell far more than expected in April, sparking concerns that Friday's U.S. jobs report will also disappoint investors. Private employers added 119,000 jobs in April, well short of the 177,000 expected, the ADP report showed. That sparked market rumors that Friday's payrolls data will show the economy added just 125,000 to 150,000 jobs last month, well below a Reuters consensus forecast of 170,000. ...

Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf, which is struggling with a debt crisis and criminal probe of its former chairman, is considering a number of alternatives including deals with other law firms. The full-merger discussions &quot;effectively ended&quot; after Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf sent an email on Monday night encouraging its partners to seek new jobs, according to the newspaper. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Investors were also disappointed with the outlook from the world's largest two-wheeled vehicle manufacturer, and expect Hero to pare its dividend payout ratios in a bid to improve its balance sheet, analysts said. &quot;We expect the Street to de-rate the stock in coming months,&quot; Morgan Stanley said in a report on Thursday, citing the dividend cut and a &quot;muted&quot; outlook as key reasons. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Private employers added 119,000 jobs in April, well short of the 177,000 expected, the ADP report showed. That sparked market rumors that Friday's payrolls data will show the economy added just 125,000 to 150,000 jobs last month, well below a Reuters consensus forecast of 170,000. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

An earlier Easter also hurt April sales by shifting demand into March. Of the 20 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters, nine missed Wall Street estimates of April sales at stores open at least a year. The Thomson Reuters same-store sales index showed a rise of 0.8 percent, short of analysts' estimates for an increase of 1.5 percent. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Cigna profit misses Wall Street target</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Insurer Cigna Corp posted a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday, as earnings slipped in its segment offering disability and life coverage policies. Cigna is the latest health insurer to miss Wall Street's earnings target in the period, following Aetna Inc , Coventry Health Care and Humana Inc . Cigna did raise its full-year earnings forecast. Net income fell to $371 million, or $1.28 per share, from $413 million, or $1.51 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Cigna's earnings of $1. ...

     <title>European shares rise as earnings reassure</title>
     <description>
      PARIS (Reuters) - European stocks rose early on Thursday after results from bellwethers Societe Generale and France Telecom reassured investors, but a sharp rise in Spain's borrowing costs at a bond auction dampened the mood. Shares in Societe Generale climbed 2.8 percent after a surprise surge in the French bank's trading revenues from its bond, currency and commodity desks helped soothe the effect of a series of one-off charges. Other banks gained ground, with French investment bank Natixis up 1.6 percent, Spain's Bankinter up 1.5 percent and Italian lender Intesa SanPaolo up 0.9 percent. ...

     <title>Dow, S&amp;P 500 fall as private-sector hiring spurs worry</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow edged lower on Wednesday as data showed that private sector hiring fell far more than expected in April, sparking concerns that Friday's U.S. jobs report will also disappoint investors. Private employers added 119,000 jobs in April, well short of the 177,000 expected, the ADP report showed. That sparked market rumors that Friday's payrolls data will show the economy added just 125,000 to 150,000 jobs last month, well below a Reuters consensus forecast of 170,000. ...

     <description>
      JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African mobile operator Vodacom said on Wednesday it expects to report a gain of up to 10 percent in full-year earnings, hit by tax on higher dividends paid and depreciation from higher capex.

      (Reuters) - Insurer Cigna Corp posted a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday, as earnings slipped in its segment offering disability and life coverage policies. Cigna is the latest health insurer to miss Wall Street's earnings target in the period, following Aetna Inc , Coventry Health Care and Humana Inc . Cigna did raise its full-year earnings forecast. Net income fell to $371 million, or $1.28 per share, from $413 million, or $1.51 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Cigna's earnings of $1. ...

     <title>European shares rise as earnings reassure</title>
     <description>
      PARIS (Reuters) - European stocks rose early on Thursday after results from bellwethers Societe Generale and France Telecom reassured investors, but a sharp rise in Spain's borrowing costs at a bond auction dampened the mood. Shares in Societe Generale climbed 2.8 percent after a surprise surge in the French bank's trading revenues from its bond, currency and commodity desks helped soothe the effect of a series of one-off charges. Other banks gained ground, with French investment bank Natixis up 1.6 percent, Spain's Bankinter up 1.5 percent and Italian lender Intesa SanPaolo up 0.9 percent. ...

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose nearly 19 percent to 2.13 billion euros (1.7 billion pounds), far better than the average estimate of just 1.77 billion from a Reuters poll of 13 banks and brokerages.

     <title>Dow, S&amp;P 500 fall as private-sector hiring spurs worry</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow edged lower on Wednesday as data showed that private sector hiring fell far more than expected in April, sparking concerns that Friday's U.S. jobs report will also disappoint investors. Private employers added 119,000 jobs in April, well short of the 177,000 expected, the ADP report showed. That sparked market rumors that Friday's payrolls data will show the economy added just 125,000 to 150,000 jobs last month, well below a Reuters consensus forecast of 170,000. ...
