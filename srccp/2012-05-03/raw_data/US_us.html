     <title>Can portfolio theory save lives?</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - With U.S. biomedical research under assault by everyone from patients to Congress for turning so few scientific discoveries into treatments, a leading finance expert says decisions about what studies to bankroll should be made the same way pension funds, mutual funds, and university endowments decide how to invest their money. Those decisions should be guided by &quot;financial portfolio theory,&quot; argues a paper published Wednesday in the science journal PLoS ONE. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles prosecutors asked a judge on Wednesday to order the execution of two condemned killers using a single drug for lethal injections, a move intended to end a 6-year hold on the death penalty in California over the method used by the state. The move comes days after Democratic Governor Jerry Brown told prison officials to consider using the single-drug execution protocol, and ahead of a November ballot measure that seeks to repeal capital punishment in the state. ...

On the social media page, Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, writes about missing his friends in Manassas, Virginia, and starting his own insurance agency in Florida. Zimmerman also seems to make reference to a pair of restraining orders that he and an ex-fianc&eacute;e filed against each other in 2005. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Oklahoma says running out of death penalty drug</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Oklahoma, which executes more prisoners per capita than any other state, said on Wednesday it has only one remaining dose of pentobarbital, a key drug used to kill condemned prisoners. One reason the state is running out is because of a ban on the sale of drugs for such purposes by the European Union, which opposes the death penalty. Oklahoma has a single vial of pentobarbital left after the execution on Tuesday night of 57-year-old Michael B. Selsor, prison spokesman Jerry Massie said. ...

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors said four Irish and British men charged in a crackdown on the international hacking group Anonymous also helped breach the security analysis company Stratfor last year.

Stratfor is dubbed a &quot;shadow CIA&quot; because it gathers non-classified intelligence on international crises. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles prosecutors asked a judge on Wednesday to order the execution of two condemned killers using a single drug for lethal injections, a move intended to end a 6-year hold on the death penalty in California over the method used by the state. The move comes days after Democratic Governor Jerry Brown told prison officials to consider using the single-drug execution protocol, and ahead of a November ballot measure that seeks to repeal capital punishment in the state. ...

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. fighter jet crashed on Thursday during a training mission in the United Arab Emirates, a U.S. official said, but no one was hurt. The F-15E Strike Eagle crashed on Thursday morning, the Air Force said in a statement. Both pilots ejected from the plane safely, and the cause of the crash is being investigated. While the Pentagon said the location of the crash could not formally be released because the host government preferred not to do so, a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plane went down in the United Arab Emirates. ...

      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Texas remains the top state for business and California still holds the title for the worst, according to an annual ranking of states by Chief Executive magazine released on Wednesday.

      KANSAS CITY, Missouri (Reuters) - A Missouri state lawmaker who is not running for reelection announced on Wednesday that he is gay, the first state-level Republican politician in the nation currently in office to do so, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund.

     <title>Oklahoma says running out of death penalty drug</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Oklahoma, which executes more prisoners per capita than any other state, said on Wednesday it has only one remaining dose of pentobarbital, a key drug used to kill condemned prisoners. One reason the state is running out is because of a ban on the sale of drugs for such purposes by the European Union, which opposes the death penalty. Oklahoma has a single vial of pentobarbital left after the execution on Tuesday night of 57-year-old Michael B. Selsor, prison spokesman Jerry Massie said. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California university student left handcuffed in a federal holding cell for nearly five days without food or water has filed a claim for up to $20 million in compensation, saying he suffered kidney failure and nearly died as a result. The five-page notice, a precursor to a lawsuit against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act, was sent Wednesday to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration by a lawyer for the student, Daniel Chong, who has said he was forced to drink his own urine to stay alive. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are seeking to take control of five paintings - one valued at up to $50,000 - seized in one of Alaska's biggest wildlife-trafficking cases in recent years. Prosecutors said they hope to ultimately return the paintings to their rightful owners. The paintings were found during last year's prosecution of two Alaskans, Jesse Leboeuf and Loretta Sternbach, who pleaded guilty in July to wildlife trafficking and weapons charges. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - A microbiologist charged under an anti-terrorism law for attempting to poison her husband's mistress lost a bid to overturn her conviction on Thursday. Carol Anne Bond had argued that the U.S. federal chemical weapons act, which makes it a crime to acquire or use any chemical weapon, was meant to target terrorist activity, not the crimes of a spurned lover. A Philadelphia-based federal court rejected Bond's appeal, ruling that the government was justified in applying the law, even if it seemed a questionable move. ...

Seattle-based attorney John Henry Browne, a self-described ex-hippie who has been married seven times and used to play bass in a rock band, said he has no secrets to hide but is opposed to the check on principle. &quot;I don't think a defense lawyer should be 'vetted' by the government,&quot; Browne wrote in an email to Reuters on Thursday. &quot;It is intrusive and has a chilling effect on the right to counsel. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Seattle-based attorney John Henry Browne, a self-described ex-hippie who has been married seven times and used to play bass in a rock band, said he has no secrets to hide but is opposed to the check on principle. &quot;I don't think a defense lawyer should be 'vetted' by the government,&quot; Browne wrote in an email to Reuters on Thursday. &quot;It is intrusive and has a chilling effect on the right to counsel. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress should pass a law to give investigators freer access to certain cellphone records, an Obama administration official said on Thursday, in remarks that raised concern among advocates of civil liberties and privacy. Jason Weinstein, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's criminal division, argued that requirements for warrants at early stages of investigations would &quot;cripple&quot; prosecutors and law enforcement.

      (Reuters) - The Alabama State Senate on Thursday approved a bill allowing cash-strapped Jefferson County to revive a local jobs tax that county officials say is central to working out its $4.27 billion bankruptcy case. The bill, which must also be approved by the legislature's lower house and the governor, would allow any county in Alabama seeking relief from creditors under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to levy and collect taxes. The bill is worth about $60 million a year to Jefferson County and passed in Montgomery with a vote of 16 to 11, with one senator abstaining. ...

      EDINBURG, Texas (Reuters) - Two men face charges of harboring illegal immigrants after authorities found 115 migrants inside three small South Texas houses, some of whom had not had access to food or water for days, federal court records published on Thursday showed. Police responded to an emergency call on Wednesday from an immigrant inside one of the stash houses. The home was bound with padlocks and chains from the outside, with bars covering the windows, said Oscar Trevino, a police spokesman in Edinburg, about 15 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. ...

The home was bound with padlocks and chains from the outside, with bars covering the windows, said Oscar Trevino, a police spokesman in Edinburg, about 15 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. ...

     <title>Court rejects appeal in wife's attempt to poison mistress</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - A microbiologist charged under an anti-terrorism law for attempting to poison her husband's mistress lost a bid to overturn her conviction on Thursday. Carol Anne Bond had argued that the U.S. federal chemical weapons act, which makes it a crime to acquire or use any chemical weapon, was meant to target terrorist activity, not the crimes of a spurned lover. A Philadelphia-based federal court rejected Bond's appeal, ruling that the government was justified in applying the law, even if it seemed a questionable move. ...
