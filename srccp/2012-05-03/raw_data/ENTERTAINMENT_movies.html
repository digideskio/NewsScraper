     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - In the first clip from the sci-fi/action sequel &quot;Men in Black 3,&quot; everything old is new again. While the trailer for the film centered on Will Smith and his reprisal of his role as Agent K, the initial snippet from the film, out May 25, offers a first glimpse of Josh Brolin as a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K. In the film - the first in the franchise since 2002 - Agent J travels back in time to the 1960, back in the early days of the Men in Black agency, to prevent an alien from killing off Agent K and altering the course of time. ...

Hollywood's summer season kicks off on Friday with the release of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and as with recent years, the four-month period is dominated by superheroes, sequels and franchise reboots featuring epic battles between good and evil. Sound like something audiences have seen before? It is, and for good reason in the minds of major studio executives. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Writer-director Joss Whedon pulls off both in &quot;The Avengers,&quot; an exhilarating ode to what mainstream comics do best. In my childhood (and, admittedly, parts of my adulthood), I read the &quot;Avengers&quot; comics because they were equally concerned with character interactions and the old biff-bam-pow. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Writer-director Joss Whedon pulls off both in &quot;The Avengers,&quot; an exhilarating ode to what mainstream comics do best.

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - As &quot;The Avengers&quot; clip released last month featuring an epic battle between Iron Man and Thor proved, superheroes can have super tempers. And now the movie's writer/director Joss Whedon has filmed a promotional video for the film explaining the motivation for the super-showdown between the god of thunder and the armored crime fighter. While staying mum on the source of the rivalry, Whedon reveals that it was crucial for the feud to spring from a genuine, personal rift between the two. ...

The &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; star's ad for Popchips has raised the hackles of some in the Twitterverse, who are criticizing the ad as racist because Kutcher wears &quot;brownface&quot; in it. The commercial parodies dating-service ads, with Kutcher playing Raj, a 39-year-old &quot;Bollywood producer&quot; who's looking for love. But the ad itself isn't getting much love from Internet detractors, who are criticizing the brown makeup and stereotypical behavior he displays in the spot. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - In the first clip from the sci-fi/action sequel &quot;Men in Black 3,&quot; everything old is new again. While the trailer for the film centered on Will Smith and his reprisal of his role as Agent K, the initial snippet from the film, out May 25, offers a first glimpse of Josh Brolin as a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K. In the film - the first in the franchise since 2002 - Agent J travels back in time to the 1960, back in the early days of the Men in Black agency, to prevent an alien from killing off Agent K and altering the course of time. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - As &quot;The Avengers&quot; clip released last month featuring an epic battle between Iron Man and Thor proved, superheroes can have super tempers. And now the movie's writer/director Joss Whedon has filmed a promotional video for the film explaining the motivation for the super-showdown between the god of thunder and the armored crime fighter. While staying mum on the source of the rivalry, Whedon reveals that it was crucial for the feud to spring from a genuine, personal rift between the two. ...

Batman is in the movie, too. Christian Bale spends lots of time in Bruce Wayne mode, apparently being tormented by Tom Hardy's Bane. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - As sure as the Pope resides at the Vatican, the Catholic Church won't be organizing busloads of parishioners for fieldtrips to go see &quot;The Perfect Family.&quot; That's because this slight satirical comedy has as its center a woman so slavishly devoted to the church that she has worn blinders for years that keep her from seeing that her own family is falling apart. The film's title, &quot;The Perfect Family,&quot; is meant to be ironic with a neon yellow highlighter through it. ...

Moore now goes by @JustDemi. According to her account, the actress chose the new moniker because it's &quot;playful. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; star's ad for Popchips has raised the hackles of some in the Twitterverse, who are criticizing the ad as racist because Kutcher wears &quot;brownface&quot; in it. The commercial parodies dating-service ads, with Kutcher playing Raj, a 39-year-old &quot;Bollywood producer&quot; who's looking for love. But the ad itself isn't getting much love from Internet detractors, who are criticizing the brown makeup and stereotypical behavior he displays in the spot. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - In the first clip from the sci-fi/action sequel &quot;Men in Black 3,&quot; everything old is new again. While the trailer for the film centered on Will Smith and his reprisal of his role as Agent K, the initial snippet from the film, out May 25, offers a first glimpse of Josh Brolin as a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K. In the film - the first in the franchise since 2002 - Agent J travels back in time to the 1960, back in the early days of the Men in Black agency, to prevent an alien from killing off Agent K and altering the course of time. ...

     <title>Review: &quot;The Perfect Family&quot; is far from perfect</title>
     <description>

The film's title, &quot;The Perfect Family,&quot; is meant to be ironic with a neon yellow highlighter through it. ...
