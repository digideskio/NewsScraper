     <title>Fuel for the Fire</title>
     <description>
      The price of oil is inexorably on the ascent. Projections show that the coming years will bring spikes in oil and gasoline costs that will strain household budgets and kneecap economic growth. Also on the rise are fossil-fuel emissions, spewed daily from cars, power plants, and factories—all of which scientists say are leading to a warming planet, rising sea levels, increased flooding, longer droughts, and stronger, more-devastating storms.

     <description>
      Mitt Romney is campaigning in Virginia this week with the state's governor, Bob McDonnell, in a presumed tryout to become the future Republican nominee's running mate.McDonnell, who has served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association since 2011, is restricted from running for a second term as governor under Virginia state law, so he just might be open for a new job before his term concludes in 2013.

     <title>It's Time to Retire the Phrase, 'This Is the Most Important Election ...'</title>
     <description>

But what inspires pundits to declare that &quot;this is the most important election of our lives&quot;?
