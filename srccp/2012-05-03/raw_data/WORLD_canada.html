Experts fear the quality will fall as well, hurting Statscan's global reputation and compromising data that shapes government financial and social policy, as well as business investment. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Canaport LNG terminal closed for planned work</title>
     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The Canaport liquefied natural gas import terminal at Saint John, New Brunswick, will be closed until mid-month as the company works on its C$43 million ($43.5 million) Boil-Off Gas project to cut emissions on the site. Kate Shannon, a spokeswoman for Canaport, said the work is not expected to delay any planned cargoes at the terminal during the two-week shutdown. Work on the BOG project includes installing a fourth boil-off gas compressor and a new booster gas compressor. ($1 = 0.9890 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Scott Haggett)

     <title>Manufacturing PMI hits 2012 high in April</title>
     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - The pace of growth in Canadian manufacturing advanced at its strongest rate of the year in April as business conditions improved for a third straight month, reflecting a slow but steady recovery in the export-reliant sector. The RBC Canadian Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, released on Tuesday, rose to a reading of 53.3 in April versus 52.4 in March, above the 50 no-change mark that separates expansion from contraction. &quot;As the economy south of the border strengthens, we expect the Canadian manufacturing sector will continue to reap the benefits of increasing U.S. ...

     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada's natural resources minister said on Wednesday he approved Ontario Power Generation's plans for a multibillion-dollar expansion of the Darlington nuclear power station near Toronto, saying the project is not likely to cause adverse environmental impact. The project, which had been vetted by a joint review panel, would add four new reactors generating up to 4,800 megawatts. Government-owned Ontario Power Generation must now seek a site preparation license from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. ...

While the world's largest automaker posted a first-quarter profit that surpassed forecasts, the outlook for its core market fell short of expectations. GM's results and outlook echoed those of smaller rival Ford Motor Co , which last week also posted a stronger-than-expected profit, but offered a disappointing outlook. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - Maple Group said on Thursday it would accept a regulator's conditions on its C$3.8 billion ($3.84 billion) bid for TMX Group , likely paving the way for the elusive takeover of the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange to go ahead. The consortium of Canada's largest banks, insurers and pension plans said that if the terms from the Ontario Securities Commission survive a 30-day comment period, it would accept them, allowing Maple to win control of the Toronto exchange in a deal that will give it some 85 percent of Canadian stock trades. ...

If it's in the fall, it will be in the fall,&quot; Lebel said, speaking to reporters by conference call from Germany. Grain companies and farmers have long complained about lacking clout to deal with the two railways - Canadian National Railway Co and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd - to ensure adequate service. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      DEER LODGE, Montana (Reuters) - The sole Canadian on death row in the United States asked Montana's parole board for clemency on Wednesday, saying he was a changed man who felt &quot;horrendously sorry&quot; for murdering two young men 30 years ago on an Indian reservation. Ronald Smith's plea came during a hearing that marked the first time the 54-year-old convicted killer, who once said he committed the murders in a drunken, drug-fueled rage because he &quot;wanted to know what it felt like,&quot; heard directly from relatives of his victims. ...

     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The Canaport liquefied natural gas import terminal at Saint John, New Brunswick, will be closed until mid-month as the company works on its C$43 million ($43.5 million) Boil-Off Gas project to cut emissions on the site. Kate Shannon, a spokeswoman for Canaport, said the work is not expected to delay any planned cargoes at the terminal during the two-week shutdown. Work on the BOG project includes installing a fourth boil-off gas compressor and a new booster gas compressor. ($1 = 0.9890 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Scott Haggett)

     <title>Canada OKs Ontario's Darlington nuclear expansion</title>
     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada's natural resources minister said on Wednesday he approved Ontario Power Generation's plans for a multibillion-dollar expansion of the Darlington nuclear power station near Toronto, saying the project is not likely to cause adverse environmental impact. The project, which had been vetted by a joint review panel, would add four new reactors generating up to 4,800 megawatts.

Chief among them are co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, venture firm Accel Partners, early investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Russian tycoon Yuri Milner's DST, and investment bank Goldman Sachs. ...

      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Regulators won't force a dissident Telus Corp shareholder to reveal how and why it acquired a large block of the Canadian telecom's voting shares ahead of a ballot on whether to give equal status to its non-voting shares. Telus, the country's No.2 telecommunications provider, had asked the British Columbia Securities Commission to force Mason Capital Management LLC to say when it acquired 19 percent of the voting shares and at what price. It also wanted Mason to detail all its trading in the stock. ...

Hawker, which was bought by the private equity firms in 2007 for $3.3 billion, said the moves included a commitment for $400 million in debtor-in-possession financing, which would allow it to continue operating and paying employees, suppliers and vendors. ...

Stocks turned lower, government debt pared losses and the U.S. dollar trimmed gains against the yen after the Institute for Supply Management said its services sector index fell to 53.5 in April from 56.0 the previous month. The report missed economists' forecasts of a reading of 55.5, according to a Reuters survey. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Canadian killer on Montana's death row seeks clemency</title>
     <description>
      DEER LODGE, Montana (Reuters) - The sole Canadian on death row in the United States asked Montana's parole board for clemency on Wednesday, saying he was a changed man who felt &quot;horrendously sorry&quot; for murdering two young men 30 years ago on an Indian reservation. Ronald Smith's plea came during a hearing that marked the first time the 54-year-old convicted killer, who once said he committed the murders in a drunken, drug-fueled rage because he &quot;wanted to know what it felt like,&quot; heard directly from relatives of his victims. ...

Analysts were expecting a 0.2 percent month-on-month increase. &quot;I'm very cautious about looking at statistics that relate only to one month ... So far I'm comfortable the indicators that I see (show) that we're on track with our budget expectations,&quot; Flaherty told BNN television. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Canaport LNG terminal closed for planned work</title>
     <description>
      CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The Canaport liquefied natural gas import terminal at Saint John, New Brunswick, will be closed until mid-month as the company works on its C$43 million ($43.5 million) Boil-Off Gas project to cut emissions on the site. Kate Shannon, a spokeswoman for Canaport, said the work is not expected to delay any planned cargoes at the terminal during the two-week shutdown. Work on the BOG project includes installing a fourth boil-off gas compressor and a new booster gas compressor. ($1 = 0.9890 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Scott Haggett)
