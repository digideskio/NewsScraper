     <title>What Walter Isaacson Thinks of Social Media and Politics</title>
     <description>
      Walter Isaacson has attended many White House Correspondents' dinners as a journalist, media mogul, and historian.

     <title>Facebook Creates Organ Donor Badge -- is it the Ultimate in Friending?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Facebook is unveiling a new badge of honor, one that will tell the world you are an organ donor. This might seem like a great idea and might have risen out of pure altruism, but it is a badge I will not be seeking. I am a registered organ donor and have made sure my family and friends are aware of these wishes.

     <title>Kuwaitis worry Twitter cases stir sectarian tensions</title>
     <description>
      KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait is about to take a firmer line on regulation of social media, uneasy about people who it says use Twitter and Facebook to stoke sectarian tensions and wary of spillover from turmoil in nearby Gulf states and Syria. Although Kuwait has largely been spared the sectarian violence that flares in other countries in the region, the Sunni government is constantly aware of the potential for Sunni-Shi'ite tensions to boil over. Authorities are particularly sensitive to developments in Bahrain, where the Sunni monarchy has cracked down on mainly Shi'ite Muslim protesters. ...

     <description>
      If you're a concerned parent, don't let the&nbsp;expos&eacute;-like title (&quot;Tweens' Secret Lives Online&quot;) of Katherine Rosman's article in today's Wall Street Journal fool you--it's a perfect guide for anyone wanting to wean their precocious child off of Facebook. Of course, if you're that precocious child, you'll probably want to add Rosman's name to your burn book under &quot;life ruiner&quot; for making you enjoy your youth for a couple more years.

     <title>Suddenly, Facebook's Advertising Problem Is a Problem</title>
     <description>
      Less than a week before Facebook starts its IPO roadshow on Monday, advertisers have started to figure out that Facebook's ad strategy isn't all that strategic.&nbsp;The social network has used its huge 800 million-strong audience to lure advertisers, but these companies want more than the feeling that &quot;engagement,&quot; &quot;sponsored posts&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; work. They want metrics and results -- something Facebook can't and doesn't measure. And that's becoming clearer to advertisers, who have started questioning Facebook's ability to bring in customers. ...

Facebook is only getting about half -- or $5.6 billion -- of the roughly $10.6 billion it plans to raise via a mega IPO.

     <title>Please Stop Calling Ashton Kutcher a 'Social Media Genius'</title>
     <description>
      The Internet's idiot-savant, Ashton Kutcher, has messed up online, again. This latest controversy revolves around him dressing up in &quot;brownface&quot; for Pop Chips, and, yes, it's as bad as it sounds. But beyond this immediate kerfuffle, we realize something. With flub after flub, does Kutcher still deserve the &quot;social media genius&quot; label thrust upon him? We dont think so.

     <title>Facebook calls on members to flag organ donor status</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tired of the long wait for a new kidney, Michael Shelling, a 50-year-old video game marketing consultant based in San Diego, decided to take a more active role in the search. About three months ago, he decided to tap into his social network by setting up a Facebook page to get the word out to his friends, and their friends, that he needs a new kidney and, by the way, his blood type is O.

     <title>Facebook IPO price range's midpoint $31.50: source</title>
     <description>
      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc plans to price its initial public offering at a range with a mid-point of $31.50 a share, a source familiar with the IPO told Reuters on Thursday. The source, who declined to be identified because the information has not been publicized, did not elaborate on other details. The world's largest social network is expected to raise as much as $10 billion this month in what would be Silicon Valley's largest-ever market debut. The company had been expected to release an updated IPO prospectus this week. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)

     <title>Why Is Facebook's IPO Price So Modest?</title>
     <description>
      Investors gritted their teeth on Thursday afternoon when&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;reported that Facebook&nbsp;will set its initial public offering&nbsp;in the high-$20 to mid-$30 range, putting the social network at a $85 to $95 billion valuation.&nbsp;Why the grimace? Well, if you've been following the parade of social media companies going public this year, you probably think that Facebook is lowballing itself a little bit. Wasn't Facebook supposed to be a $100 billion company?

Moore now goes by @JustDemi. According to her account, the actress chose the new moniker because it's &quot;playful. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

This latest controversy revolves around him dressing up in &quot;brownface&quot; for Pop Chips, and, yes, it's as bad as it sounds. But beyond this immediate kerfuffle, we realize something. With flub after flub, does Kutcher still deserve the &quot;social media genius&quot; label thrust upon him? We dont think so.

     <title>Facebook IPO price range's midpoint $31.50: source</title>
     <description>
      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc plans to price its initial public offering at a range with a mid-point of $31.50 a share, a source familiar with the IPO told Reuters on Thursday.

     <title>Why Is Facebook's IPO Price So Modest?</title>
     <description>
      Investors gritted their teeth on Thursday afternoon when&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;reported that Facebook&nbsp;will set its initial public offering&nbsp;in the high-$20 to mid-$30 range, putting the social network at a $85 to $95 billion valuation.&nbsp;Why the grimace? Well, if you've been following the parade of social media companies going public this year, you probably think that Facebook is lowballing itself a little bit. Wasn't Facebook supposed to be a $100 billion company?

     <title>Facebook isn't making us lonely. It's making us anxious. Get over it</title>
     <description>
      As a masterpiece and a cultural catastrophe at once, Facebook is distinctly American. It represents a social regime that's scintillating and hideous. The values intrinsic to it—velocity, wit, growth, exhibitionism and “connectivity”—can seem superficial, but they're ours. This week, the Facebook brass are making housecalls to investors, using razzle, dazzle and astral projections to justify valuing the eight-year-old company at a big, round $100 billion.

In just the last two days we've seen two twitter hashtags, at two separate tech conferences, overwhelmed by spam bots, one from The Guardian's Activate NYC conference and another from Wired's Business Conference.&nbsp;
