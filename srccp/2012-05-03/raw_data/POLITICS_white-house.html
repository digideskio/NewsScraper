      Mitt Romney met with dozens of conservative journalists at a private club in Washington on Wednesday. Did they press him on the agenda he'll implement as president and report their findings back to the rank-and-file? Nope. It's only because&nbsp;The Huffington Post&nbsp;reported on the meeting that we know about it. &quot;The attendees came from numerous conservative sites and right-of-center publications, including&nbsp;National Review, [The] Daily Caller,&nbsp;American Spectator,&nbsp;Washington Examiner, Right Wing News, [Power Line], Townhall, Ace of Spades, Riehl World View, White House Dossier, and PJ Media. ...

Yes, there is discussion of his music, the 40th anniversary world tour of the progressive rock classic &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, and of its 2012 follow up. But there is also a lot more about flutes in space, an unlikely link with the George W. Bush White House - and the importance of prostate examinations. Anderson, now 64 and dapper rather than the frenzied druid-cum-warlock of yore, is quite clear and animated about the latter. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>What Walter Isaacson Thinks of Social Media and Politics</title>
     <description>

This is thanks to a career that's included serving as editor of Time Magazine, chairman and CEO of CNN, president and CEO of The Aspen Institute, and historical biographer.

This is why every day The Atlantic Wire highlights the videos that truly earn your five minutes (or less) of attention. Today: Bruce Springsteen should have covered &quot;The Weight&quot; years ago, Sam Kass talks White House pantry protocol, and the Potato Heads have been married 60 years.
