     <title>Kids on cow farms may have fewer allergies</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Kids who grow up on farms and have contact with cows and cow milk are less likely to have allergies and asthma than kids raised nearby but not on a farm, according to a new study from Europe. Researchers had previously noticed that kids raised on European farms have lower rates of asthma and allergies than other children (see Reuters Health story of June 1, 2010). But the new findings help identify, at least in part, what specifically may protect some farm-raised youngsters against developing asthma or allergies. &quot;Nature can really teach us something here,&quot; said Dr. ...

     <title>Bird flu paper that raised bioterrorism fears published</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - The journal Nature has published the first of two controversial papers about laboratory-enhanced versions of the deadly bird flu virus that initially sparked fears among U.S. biosecurity experts that it could be used as a recipe for a bioterrorism weapon. The publication of the paper by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, on Wednesday follows months of acrimonious debate that pitted the need for science to be free of censorship against the obligation to protect the public from a potentially devastating flu pandemic. ...

     <title>How depression led to my weight problems</title>
     <description>
      Depression runs in my family the way athletic ability may run in others. It really shouldn't have came as a surprise to me that I, too, would end up with a form of depression. Looking back, I had problems for most of my life. I wasn't until I was 19 that I was put on medication, which I stayed on for a few months. After being the victim of a robbery in 2004, it triggered something that turned my life upside down. It wasn't until much later that I came to the realization that something was terribly wrong and was diagnosed with depression. ...

     <title>Kids on cow farms may have fewer allergies</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Kids who grow up on farms and have contact with cows and cow milk are less likely to have allergies and asthma than kids raised nearby but not on a farm, according to a new study from Europe. Researchers had previously noticed that kids raised on European farms have lower rates of asthma and allergies than other children (see Reuters Health story of June 1, 2010). But the new findings help identify, at least in part, what specifically may protect some farm-raised youngsters against developing asthma or allergies. &quot;Nature can really teach us something here,&quot; said Dr. ...

     <title>Bird flu paper that raised bioterrorism fears published</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - The journal Nature has published the first of two controversial papers about laboratory-enhanced versions of the deadly bird flu virus that initially sparked fears among U.S. biosecurity experts that it could be used as a recipe for a bioterrorism weapon. The publication of the paper by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, on Wednesday follows months of acrimonious debate that pitted the need for science to be free of censorship against the obligation to protect the public from a potentially devastating flu pandemic. ...

     <title>Kids on cow farms may have fewer allergies</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Kids who grow up on farms and have contact with cows and cow milk are less likely to have allergies and asthma than kids raised nearby but not on a farm, according to a new study from Europe. Researchers had previously noticed that kids raised on European farms have lower rates of asthma and allergies than other children (see Reuters Health story of June 1, 2010). But the new findings help identify, at least in part, what specifically may protect some farm-raised youngsters against developing asthma or allergies. &quot;Nature can really teach us something here,&quot; said Dr. ...

     <title>Bird flu paper that raised bioterrorism fears published</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - The journal Nature has published the first of two controversial papers about laboratory-enhanced versions of the deadly bird flu virus that initially sparked fears among U.S. biosecurity experts that it could be used as a recipe for a bioterrorism weapon. The publication of the paper by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, on Wednesday follows months of acrimonious debate that pitted the need for science to be free of censorship against the obligation to protect the public from a potentially devastating flu pandemic. ...

      Depression runs in my family the way athletic ability may run in others. It really shouldn't have came as a surprise to me that I, too, would end up with a form of depression.
