     <title>The Supreme Court's historically low approval ratings: 4 theories</title>
     <description>
      The Supreme Court's favorability rating is at a 25-year low, according to a new poll from the Pew Research Center. The survey shows that only 52 percent of Americans view the court favorably, and while Congress can only dream of such a stratospheric number, the court enjoyed an 80 percent approval rating as recently as 1994. Remarkably, a roughly equal percentage of Democrats and Republicans approve of the court, a rare show of agreement in this age of hyper-partisanship. Here, four theories about why the Supreme Court's popularity is waning:1. The court has become increasingly politicized ...

     <title>Kentucky's cash-strapped courts to shut temporarily</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Kentucky's top judge announced plans on Wednesday to temporarily shut down the state's court system to cope with what he characterized as &quot;deep cuts&quot; in the judiciary's budget. John Minton Jr., the chief justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court, said 3,700 workers, including more than 400 judges and circuit court clerks, would be furloughed without pay for three days between August and October, forcing courthouses statewide to close. ...

     <title>The Simon Wiesenthal Center's Final Response</title>
     <description>
      Simply put, Professor Khalidi’s real problem is that he refuses to accept that the Supreme Court of Israel is unbiased.&nbsp; Most people living in Israel—Jews, Christians and Muslims—know that the Court has always had a record of bending over backwards, especially in protection of minorities.&nbsp; At the same time, it is important to remember that Sheik Raed Salah, a member of the Hamas-linked Northern Party, was the one who first brought the case to the Court.&nbsp;

      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - A convicted Oklahoma killer who was spared execution once but asked for a new trial and was sentenced to death a second time is set to be put to death on Tuesday. Michael B. Selsor was convicted of killing a Tulsa convenience store clerk in 1975.

Bronx Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon's decision ensures accuser Nafissatou Diallo can continue to press claims for monetary damages and prevents Strauss-Kahn from putting the May 14 incident fully behind him, even as he attempts to relaunch his career by giving speeches on the world conference circuit. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>No Immunity: DSK Can't Dodge a New York Civil Trial After All</title>
     <description>
      Dominique Strauss-Kahn had been hoping his legal entanglements in the United States would end on Tuesday when a Bronx judge decided whether to accept his argument that diplomatic immunity protected him from a lawsuit, but the judge did no such thing. In fact,&nbsp;State Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon seemed to relish the chance to explain a bit of diplomatic history in his 12-page decision&nbsp;that went live on the Bronx County Clerk's website Tuesday, while also flatly denying Strauss-Kahn his immunity claim.&nbsp;

     <title>Oklahoma court rejects ballot initiative on &quot;personhood&quot;</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Monday struck down a ballot initiative that sought voter approval of a so-called &quot;personhood&quot; amendment to the state constitution to define an embryo as a human being from the moment of conception. The ballot question would have asked Oklahoma voters to expand the definition of a human being to include a fertilized egg. But the state's highest court said the proposed constitutional amendment was &quot;void on its face&quot; because the U.S. Supreme Court already has decided the issue. ...

      A federal appeals court will hear arguments about whether companies can patent genes on July 20. The &nbsp;American Civil Liberties Union&nbsp;has challenged Myriad Genetics’ patents on the BRCA 1 and BRCA2 genes, which affect the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

     <title>Why are tech companies backing CISPA?</title>
     <description>
      Late last week, the House passed the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), despite a veto threat from President Obama. Privacy advocates and the media were especially alarmed by last-minute amendments, leading to &quot;dramatic headlines like 'Insanity: CISPA just got way worse..' and 'CISPA is ridiculously hideous,'&quot; says Jeff John Roberts at GigaOm. Earlier this year, the same kind of alarm bells, plus a heavy dose of &quot;internet muscle&quot; from big technology companies, were enough to derail another piece of proposed internet regulation, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). ...

     <description>
      Justice Byron R. White served on the Supreme Court for 31 years, but now, a decade after his death, he remains something of an enigma. A blunt, often irascible man, he turned out to be considerably more conservative than expected…

With a full slate of big-budget action films from Sony's &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; to Warner Bros' &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; vying for the same fanboy audience, female filmgoers may hold the key to box-office dominance. ...

     <title>The Supreme Court's historically low approval ratings: 4 theories</title>
     <description>
      The Supreme Court's favorability rating is at a 25-year low, according to a new poll from the Pew Research Center. The survey shows that only 52 percent of Americans view the court favorably, and while Congress can only dream of such a stratospheric number, the court enjoyed an 80 percent approval rating as recently as 1994. Remarkably, a roughly equal percentage of Democrats and Republicans approve of the court, a rare show of agreement in this age of hyper-partisanship. Here, four theories about why the Supreme Court's popularity is waning:1. The court has become increasingly politicized ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Kentucky's top judge announced plans on Wednesday to temporarily shut down the state's court system to cope with what he characterized as &quot;deep cuts&quot; in the judiciary's budget.

     <title>The Simon Wiesenthal Center's Final Response</title>
     <description>
      Simply put, Professor Khalidi’s real problem is that he refuses to accept that the Supreme Court of Israel is unbiased.&nbsp; Most people living in Israel—Jews, Christians and Muslims—know that the Court has always had a record of bending over backwards, especially in protection of minorities.&nbsp; At the same time, it is important to remember that Sheik Raed Salah, a member of the Hamas-linked Northern Party, was the one who first brought the case to the Court.&nbsp;

      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - A convicted Oklahoma killer who was spared execution once but asked for a new trial and was sentenced to death a second time is set to be put to death on Tuesday. Michael B. Selsor was convicted of killing a Tulsa convenience store clerk in 1975. After he was sentenced to death, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that Oklahoma's capital punishment law was unconstitutional and his sentence was modified to life in prison. ...

     <title>No Immunity: DSK Can't Dodge a New York Civil Trial After All</title>

      Dominique Strauss-Kahn had been hoping his legal entanglements in the United States would end on Tuesday when a Bronx judge decided whether to accept his argument that diplomatic immunity protected him from a lawsuit, but the judge did no such thing. In fact,&nbsp;State Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon seemed to relish the chance to explain a bit of diplomatic history in his 12-page decision&nbsp;that went live on the Bronx County Clerk's website Tuesday, while also flatly denying Strauss-Kahn his immunity claim.&nbsp;

      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Monday struck down a ballot initiative that sought voter approval of a so-called &quot;personhood&quot; amendment to the state constitution to define an embryo as a human being from the moment of conception. The ballot question would have asked Oklahoma voters to expand the definition of a human being to include a fertilized egg. But the state's highest court said the proposed constitutional amendment was &quot;void on its face&quot; because the U.S. Supreme Court already has decided the issue. ...

     <title>The Supreme Court's historically low approval ratings: 4 theories</title>
     <description>
      The Supreme Court's favorability rating is at a 25-year low, according to a new poll from the Pew Research Center. The survey shows that only 52 percent of Americans view the court favorably, and while Congress can only dream of such a stratospheric number, the court enjoyed an 80 percent approval rating as recently as 1994. Remarkably, a roughly equal percentage of Democrats and Republicans approve of the court, a rare show of agreement in this age of hyper-partisanship. Here, four theories about why the Supreme Court's popularity is waning:1. The court has become increasingly politicized ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Kentucky's top judge announced plans on Wednesday to temporarily shut down the state's court system to cope with what he characterized as &quot;deep cuts&quot; in the judiciary's budget. John Minton Jr., the chief justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court, said 3,700 workers, including more than 400 judges and circuit court clerks, would be furloughed without pay for three days between August and October, forcing courthouses statewide to close. ...

     <title>The Simon Wiesenthal Center's Final Response</title>
     <description>
      Simply put, Professor Khalidi’s real problem is that he refuses to accept that the Supreme Court of Israel is unbiased.&nbsp; Most people living in Israel—Jews, Christians and Muslims—know that the Court has always had a record of bending over backwards, especially in protection of minorities.&nbsp; At the same time, it is important to remember that Sheik Raed Salah, a member of the Hamas-linked Northern Party, was the one who first brought the case to the Court.&nbsp;

      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - A convicted Oklahoma killer who was spared execution once but asked for a new trial and was sentenced to death a second time is set to be put to death on Tuesday. Michael B. Selsor was convicted of killing a Tulsa convenience store clerk in 1975. After he was sentenced to death, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that Oklahoma's capital punishment law was unconstitutional and his sentence was modified to life in prison. ...

     <title>No Immunity: DSK Can't Dodge a New York Civil Trial After All</title>

      Dominique Strauss-Kahn had been hoping his legal entanglements in the United States would end on Tuesday when a Bronx judge decided whether to accept his argument that diplomatic immunity protected him from a lawsuit, but the judge did no such thing. In fact,&nbsp;State Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon seemed to relish the chance to explain a bit of diplomatic history in his 12-page decision&nbsp;that went live on the Bronx County Clerk's website Tuesday, while also flatly denying Strauss-Kahn his immunity claim.&nbsp;

      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Monday struck down a ballot initiative that sought voter approval of a so-called &quot;personhood&quot; amendment to the state constitution to define an embryo as a human being from the moment of conception. The ballot question would have asked Oklahoma voters to expand the definition of a human being to include a fertilized egg. But the state's highest court said the proposed constitutional amendment was &quot;void on its face&quot; because the U.S. Supreme Court already has decided the issue. ...
