     <title>Facebook calls on members to flag organ donor status</title>
     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tired of the long wait for a new kidney, Michael Shelling, a 50-year-old video game marketing consultant based in San Diego, decided to take a more active role in the search. About three months ago, he decided to tap into his social network by setting up a Facebook page to get the word out to his friends, and their friends, that he needs a new kidney and, by the way, his blood type is O. The search may have paid off. A potential donor is going through testing to see if they are a match. It is the kind of scenario Facebook hopes to foster. ...

     <title>Facebook IPO price range's midpoint $31.50: source</title>
     <description>
      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc plans to price its initial public offering at a range with a mid-point of $31.50 a share, a source familiar with the IPO told Reuters on Thursday. The source, who declined to be identified because the information has not been publicized, did not elaborate on other details. The world's largest social network is expected to raise as much as $10 billion this month in what would be Silicon Valley's largest-ever market debut. The company had been expected to release an updated IPO prospectus this week. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)

     <title>ValueClick shares slide on revenue miss</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Shares of ValueClick Inc plunged 29 percent after the online marketer posted quarterly revenue that missed estimates and forecast weak second-quarter revenue, saying some deals will not start contributing till later in the year. The company's shares, which had rallied to a 4-year high of $21.60 on Tuesday, fell to $15.43 in Thursday morning trading, making them one of the biggest percentage losers on the Nasdaq. The losses wiped off more than $500 million from ValueClick's market capitalization within the first hour of trading. ...

     <description>
      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc plans to price its initial public offering at a range with a mid-point of $31.50 a share, a source familiar with the IPO told Reuters on Thursday. The source, who declined to be identified because the information has not been publicized, did not elaborate on other details. The world's largest social network is expected to raise as much as $10 billion this month in what would be Silicon Valley's largest-ever market debut.

      CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tired of the long wait for a new kidney, Michael Shelling, a 50-year-old video game marketing consultant based in San Diego, decided to take a more active role in the search. About three months ago, he decided to tap into his social network by setting up a Facebook page to get the word out to his friends, and their friends, that he needs a new kidney and, by the way, his blood type is O. The search may have paid off. A potential donor is going through testing to see if they are a match. It is the kind of scenario Facebook hopes to foster. ...
