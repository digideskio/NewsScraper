     <title>Review: &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack comes up skimpy</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - There's an old adage that goes &quot;Leave â€˜em wanting more,&quot; and although that may not be a specifically Broadway or TV adage, it's been adopted for the &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack album, which solves the problem of whether to fill the disc up with pop covers or musical-comedy originals by not offering enough of either. Another five-letter S-word would seem to apply: s-k-i-m-p. ...

     <title>Review: Underwood's &quot;Blown Away&quot; is a breeze</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It's a good thing that you can't judge a book by its sleeve art, because Carrie Underwood's fourth album, &quot;Blown Away,&quot; arrives this week bearing one of the tackiest country music album covers of all time - a ludicrously airbrushed portrait that dares you not to focus on Underwood's gleaming, Angelina-like right gam while the star gazes into the distance like a fembot on a romance-novel jacket. It's a relief to find the music inside is better... sometimes, much better. ...

     <title>Review: Harrison's &quot;Early Takes&quot; is beautifully bare</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Back in 2003, the surviving Beatles authorized the release of &quot;Let It Be... Naked,&quot; an album of remixes that stripped away the most outlandish production flourishes producer Phil Spector had added to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 1970. In a way, the new George Harrison release &quot;Early Takes, Volume 1&quot; does the same thing for the former Beatle's Spector-produced 1970 solo debut, &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; as, among other selections, it offers up six songs from that landmark effort in completely unvarnished form. ...

     <title>Spoofs take steam out of &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Spanking, sex and submission are raking in profits for erotic novel &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;, reinvigorating marriages and sparking anguished debates among feminists, but there has been one unintended result of the novel - laughter. The best-selling book by British writer E.L. James that has taken pop culture by storm also has become ripe for spoofs and parodies, even as Hollywood is agog over who will play the leads in an upcoming movie. ...

     <title>Writer worked to make vampires scary again</title>
     <description>
      TOKYO (Reuters) - What with romance and suave, sensitive characters, vampires weren't scary enough for author David Wellington anymore. So he decided to see if he could bring some terror back to tales about the centuries-old undead creatures. The result was five books starring policewoman Laura Caxton and Justinia Malvern, the ancient vampire she fights, climaxing in the just-released &quot;32 Fangs&quot; - a chilling, sometimes graphic tale of their final, epic battle. ...

     <title>Book reveals hidden horror of N.Korean labor camps</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - &quot;Escape From Camp 14&quot; makes for grim reading. Journalist Blaine Harden's account of a young man's life in and escape from a labor camp in secretive North Korea has drawn parallels with the Soviet gulags and Nazi Holocaust. One big difference is that North Korea's political prison camps, holding an estimated 200,000 people and handing out their own brand of extreme cruelty, are still operating. The story of Shin Dong-hyuk combines a thrilling and unique tale of escape with a harrowing memoir of Camp 14, which lies to the northeast of the capital Pyongyang. ...

     <title>&quot;Chimpanzee&quot; presents sanitized jungle</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Chimpanzees eat monkeys. That's one of the big takeaways from &quot;Chimpanzee,&quot; the latest in the DisneyNature series of documentaries. We don't get to see this happen in a way that would jeopardize the movie's G rating, of course, but between description (by narrator Tim Allen) and implication, we get the general idea. And while that's certainly educational â€” it's the first thing that's going to come to my mind next time I need to distinguish between the two animals â€” the movie's coyness about portraying that fact of life pinpoints the general problem with &quot;Chimpanzee. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Marcel Beyer's latest novel takes place in postwar Dresden, but the award-winning German author didn't actually set foot there until the mid-1990s.

That book is &quot;Kaltenburg.&quot; Originally published in Germany several years ago, it was released in the United States on Tuesday and is Beyer's latest book to be translated into English by the writer who the New Yorker magazine designated as one of the current best young European novelists. ...

     <title>Review: Harrison's &quot;Early Takes&quot; is beautifully bare</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Back in 2003, the surviving Beatles authorized the release of &quot;Let It Be... Naked,&quot; an album of remixes that stripped away the most outlandish production flourishes producer Phil Spector had added to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 1970. In a way, the new George Harrison release &quot;Early Takes, Volume 1&quot; does the same thing for the former Beatle's Spector-produced 1970 solo debut, &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; as, among other selections, it offers up six songs from that landmark effort in completely unvarnished form. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It's a good thing that you can't judge a book by its sleeve art, because Carrie Underwood's fourth album, &quot;Blown Away,&quot; arrives this week bearing one of the tackiest country music album covers of all time - a ludicrously airbrushed portrait that dares you not to focus on Underwood's gleaming, Angelina-like right gam while the star gazes into the distance like a fembot on a romance-novel jacket. It's a relief to find the music inside is better... sometimes, much better. ...

     <title>Review: &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack comes up skimpy</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - There's an old adage that goes &quot;Leave â€˜em wanting more,&quot; and although that may not be a specifically Broadway or TV adage, it's been adopted for the &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack album, which solves the problem of whether to fill the disc up with pop covers or musical-comedy originals by not offering enough of either. Another five-letter S-word would seem to apply: s-k-i-m-p. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It's a good thing that you can't judge a book by its sleeve art, because Carrie Underwood's fourth album, &quot;Blown Away,&quot; arrives this week bearing one of the tackiest country music album covers of all time - a ludicrously airbrushed portrait that dares you not to focus on Underwood's gleaming, Angelina-like right gam while the star gazes into the distance like a fembot on a romance-novel jacket. It's a relief to find the music inside is better... sometimes, much better. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Back in 2003, the surviving Beatles authorized the release of &quot;Let It Be... Naked,&quot; an album of remixes that stripped away the most outlandish production flourishes producer Phil Spector had added to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 1970. In a way, the new George Harrison release &quot;Early Takes, Volume 1&quot; does the same thing for the former Beatle's Spector-produced 1970 solo debut, &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; as, among other selections, it offers up six songs from that landmark effort in completely unvarnished form. ...

     <title>Spoofs take steam out of &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Spanking, sex and submission are raking in profits for erotic novel &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;, reinvigorating marriages and sparking anguished debates among feminists, but there has been one unintended result of the novel - laughter. The best-selling book by British writer E.L. James that has taken pop culture by storm also has become ripe for spoofs and parodies, even as Hollywood is agog over who will play the leads in an upcoming movie. ...

     <title>Writer worked to make vampires scary again</title>
     <description>
      TOKYO (Reuters) - What with romance and suave, sensitive characters, vampires weren't scary enough for author David Wellington anymore. So he decided to see if he could bring some terror back to tales about the centuries-old undead creatures. The result was five books starring policewoman Laura Caxton and Justinia Malvern, the ancient vampire she fights, climaxing in the just-released &quot;32 Fangs&quot; - a chilling, sometimes graphic tale of their final, epic battle. ...

     <title>Book reveals hidden horror of N.Korean labor camps</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - &quot;Escape From Camp 14&quot; makes for grim reading. Journalist Blaine Harden's account of a young man's life in and escape from a labor camp in secretive North Korea has drawn parallels with the Soviet gulags and Nazi Holocaust. One big difference is that North Korea's political prison camps, holding an estimated 200,000 people and handing out their own brand of extreme cruelty, are still operating.

     <title>&quot;Chimpanzee&quot; presents sanitized jungle</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Chimpanzees eat monkeys. That's one of the big takeaways from &quot;Chimpanzee,&quot; the latest in the DisneyNature series of documentaries. We don't get to see this happen in a way that would jeopardize the movie's G rating, of course, but between description (by narrator Tim Allen) and implication, we get the general idea. And while that's certainly educational â€” it's the first thing that's going to come to my mind next time I need to distinguish between the two animals â€” the movie's coyness about portraying that fact of life pinpoints the general problem with &quot;Chimpanzee. ...

Monday's lack of a decision by the Pulitzer board could also hurt an industry accused of fixing prices for e-books, critics said.

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Marcel Beyer's latest novel takes place in postwar Dresden, but the award-winning German author didn't actually set foot there until the mid-1990s. When he did, he knew &quot;from the very first day&quot; that he had a book to write. That book is &quot;Kaltenburg.&quot; Originally published in Germany several years ago, it was released in the United States on Tuesday and is Beyer's latest book to be translated into English by the writer who the New Yorker magazine designated as one of the current best young European novelists. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - As sure as the Pope resides at the Vatican, the Catholic Church won't be organizing busloads of parishioners for fieldtrips to go see &quot;The Perfect Family.&quot; That's because this slight satirical comedy has as its center a woman so slavishly devoted to the church that she has worn blinders for years that keep her from seeing that her own family is falling apart. The film's title, &quot;The Perfect Family,&quot; is meant to be ironic with a neon yellow highlighter through it. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - There's an old adage that goes &quot;Leave â€˜em wanting more,&quot; and although that may not be a specifically Broadway or TV adage, it's been adopted for the &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack album, which solves the problem of whether to fill the disc up with pop covers or musical-comedy originals by not offering enough of either. Another five-letter S-word would seem to apply: s-k-i-m-p. ...

     <title>Review: Harrison's &quot;Early Takes&quot; is beautifully bare</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Back in 2003, the surviving Beatles authorized the release of &quot;Let It Be... Naked,&quot; an album of remixes that stripped away the most outlandish production flourishes producer Phil Spector had added to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 1970. In a way, the new George Harrison release &quot;Early Takes, Volume 1&quot; does the same thing for the former Beatle's Spector-produced 1970 solo debut, &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; as, among other selections, it offers up six songs from that landmark effort in completely unvarnished form. ...

     <title>Review: Underwood's &quot;Blown Away&quot; is a breeze</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It's a good thing that you can't judge a book by its sleeve art, because Carrie Underwood's fourth album, &quot;Blown Away,&quot; arrives this week bearing one of the tackiest country music album covers of all time - a ludicrously airbrushed portrait that dares you not to focus on Underwood's gleaming, Angelina-like right gam while the star gazes into the distance like a fembot on a romance-novel jacket. It's a relief to find the music inside is better... sometimes, much better. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - As sure as the Pope resides at the Vatican, the Catholic Church won't be organizing busloads of parishioners for fieldtrips to go see &quot;The Perfect Family.&quot; That's because this slight satirical comedy has as its center a woman so slavishly devoted to the church that she has worn blinders for years that keep her from seeing that her own family is falling apart. The film's title, &quot;The Perfect Family,&quot; is meant to be ironic with a neon yellow highlighter through it. ...

Writer-director Joss Whedon pulls off both in &quot;The Avengers,&quot; an exhilarating ode to what mainstream comics do best. In my childhood (and, admittedly, parts of my adulthood), I read the &quot;Avengers&quot; comics because they were equally concerned with character interactions and the old biff-bam-pow. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Writer-director Joss Whedon pulls off both in &quot;The Avengers,&quot; an exhilarating ode to what mainstream comics do best. In my childhood (and, admittedly, parts of my adulthood), I read the &quot;Avengers&quot; comics because they were equally concerned with character interactions and the old biff-bam-pow. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Review: &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack comes up skimpy</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - There's an old adage that goes &quot;Leave â€˜em wanting more,&quot; and although that may not be a specifically Broadway or TV adage, it's been adopted for the &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack album, which solves the problem of whether to fill the disc up with pop covers or musical-comedy originals by not offering enough of either. Another five-letter S-word would seem to apply: s-k-i-m-p. ...

     <title>Review: Underwood's &quot;Blown Away&quot; is a breeze</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It's a good thing that you can't judge a book by its sleeve art, because Carrie Underwood's fourth album, &quot;Blown Away,&quot; arrives this week bearing one of the tackiest country music album covers of all time - a ludicrously airbrushed portrait that dares you not to focus on Underwood's gleaming, Angelina-like right gam while the star gazes into the distance like a fembot on a romance-novel jacket. It's a relief to find the music inside is better... sometimes, much better. ...

     <title>Review: Harrison's &quot;Early Takes&quot; is beautifully bare</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Back in 2003, the surviving Beatles authorized the release of &quot;Let It Be... Naked,&quot; an album of remixes that stripped away the most outlandish production flourishes producer Phil Spector had added to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 1970. In a way, the new George Harrison release &quot;Early Takes, Volume 1&quot; does the same thing for the former Beatle's Spector-produced 1970 solo debut, &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; as, among other selections, it offers up six songs from that landmark effort in completely unvarnished form. ...

     <title>Spoofs take steam out of &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Spanking, sex and submission are raking in profits for erotic novel &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;, reinvigorating marriages and sparking anguished debates among feminists, but there has been one unintended result of the novel - laughter. The best-selling book by British writer E.L. James that has taken pop culture by storm also has become ripe for spoofs and parodies, even as Hollywood is agog over who will play the leads in an upcoming movie. ...

     <title>Writer worked to make vampires scary again</title>
     <description>
      TOKYO (Reuters) - What with romance and suave, sensitive characters, vampires weren't scary enough for author David Wellington anymore. So he decided to see if he could bring some terror back to tales about the centuries-old undead creatures. The result was five books starring policewoman Laura Caxton and Justinia Malvern, the ancient vampire she fights, climaxing in the just-released &quot;32 Fangs&quot; - a chilling, sometimes graphic tale of their final, epic battle. ...

     <title>Book reveals hidden horror of N.Korean labor camps</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - &quot;Escape From Camp 14&quot; makes for grim reading. Journalist Blaine Harden's account of a young man's life in and escape from a labor camp in secretive North Korea has drawn parallels with the Soviet gulags and Nazi Holocaust. One big difference is that North Korea's political prison camps, holding an estimated 200,000 people and handing out their own brand of extreme cruelty, are still operating. The story of Shin Dong-hyuk combines a thrilling and unique tale of escape with a harrowing memoir of Camp 14, which lies to the northeast of the capital Pyongyang. ...

The woodsy, adrenalin-pumping experiences move beyond traditional tourism for fans of books and the movies they inspire, targeting enthusiasts whose passion wants another portal. &quot;We call this fandemonium,&quot; said Tammy Hopkins, co-founder of The Hunger Games Fan Tours in Brevard. &quot;These are the super fans. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Whedon's script (co-written with director Drew Goddard) contains such delicious twists and turns, however, that it's hard to discuss the film without spoiling the fun for uninitiated viewers. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Whedon's script (co-written with director Drew Goddard) contains such delicious twists and turns, however, that it's hard to discuss the film without spoiling the fun for uninitiated viewers. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - When &quot;A Little Bit of Heaven&quot; starts unfurling, you can feel the film ticking off the cutesy romantic comedy conventions, one by one: Kate Hudson (check) stars as a free-spirited ad exec (check) who has a gorgeous courtyard apartment (check) in New Orleans, complete with sassy gay neighbor (check) and adorably mush-faced bulldog (check). ...

     <title>Review: &quot;The Perfect Family&quot; is far from perfect</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - As sure as the Pope resides at the Vatican, the Catholic Church won't be organizing busloads of parishioners for fieldtrips to go see &quot;The Perfect Family.&quot; That's because this slight satirical comedy has as its center a woman so slavishly devoted to the church that she has worn blinders for years that keep her from seeing that her own family is falling apart. The film's title, &quot;The Perfect Family,&quot; is meant to be ironic with a neon yellow highlighter through it. ...

     <title>Review: &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack comes up skimpy</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - There's an old adage that goes &quot;Leave â€˜em wanting more,&quot; and although that may not be a specifically Broadway or TV adage, it's been adopted for the &quot;Smash&quot; soundtrack album, which solves the problem of whether to fill the disc up with pop covers or musical-comedy originals by not offering enough of either. Another five-letter S-word would seem to apply: s-k-i-m-p. ...
