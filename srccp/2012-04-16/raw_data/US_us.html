The justices considered an appeal by two former sales representatives for a unit of Britain's GlaxoSmithKline Plc of a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in California that they were &quot;outside sales&quot; personnel exempt from federal overtime pay requirements. That decision conflicted with an earlier ruling by the 2nd U.S. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Big Tobacco pays states $6.5 billion under accord</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Three of the biggest U.S. tobacco companies said on Monday they have paid a total of $6.5 billion this year to U.S. states under a 1998 national accord that obliged companies to help cover the health bills of ailing smokers. Altria's Philip Morris paid $3.5 billion, said spokesman Steve Callahan. But the Marlboro-maker, which makes the biggest payments, is disputing $206 million of that sum, and has put that money in escrow. The national settlement that involved most states is designed to level the playing field between companies that signed it and those that did not. ...

     <title>Kris Kobach: Immigration isn't just a federal matter</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - The battle over illegal immigration heads to the U.S. Supreme Court next week, when the court will hear arguments for and against new Arizona laws requiring police, employers and landlords to expose undocumented immigrants. Arizona of course is not alone in its crackdown on illegal immigrants, with states including Alabama, Georgia, Utah, as well as a number of cities, passing similar measures. The movement's chief legal architect is 45-year old Kris Kobach, a former constitutional law professor, current secretary of state of Kansas and adviser to Mitt Romney on immigration issues. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Boeing Co on Monday said its production system has a cushion in place that will help absorb disruptions caused by a weekend tornado that hit Spirit AeroSystems, the supplier that makes its 737 fuselage and parts of other planes. Wichita-based Spirit shut down temporarily after a tornado damaged roofs and knocked out power on Saturday night. The company said it did not yet know what the full impact would be on production, but operations would be suspended at least through Tuesday and near-term deliveries would be affected. ...

No injuries were reported from the blaze, which was triggered by a welding accident on the roof of the so-called Materials and Fuels Complex at the Idaho National Laboratory, managed by the U.S. Energy Department, lab officials said. The fire has since been put out, lab spokesman Craig Shull told Reuters. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
