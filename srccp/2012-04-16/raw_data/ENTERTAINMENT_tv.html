Sarah Silverman is not part of that tradition. With NBC soon to decide whether to give her a show in the fall, the &quot;Sarah Silverman Program&quot; star made an abortion joke that struck some as too flippant - and quickly caught the attention of the conservative Drudge Report, which made the remark one of its main stories. Silverman posted two photos on Twitter last week. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - &quot;The Simpsons&quot; used its blackboard opening sequence Sunday to reveal that Springfield is located ... somewhere far from you. &quot;The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours,&quot; Bart wrote on the blackboard in the opening of Sunday's &quot;Beware My Cheating Bart&quot; episode. That followed the beginning of the opening sequence, which read &quot;The Simpsons Now Entering Oregon.&quot; &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening said in an interview in the new issue of Smithsonian magazine that he named Springfield after the town in Oregon, which is near his hometown, Portland. ...

     <title>Investigation Discovery scares up women viewers</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - Investigation Discovery is growing fast with an old trick for luring its predominantly female viewers: Scaring and titillating them with stories of shocking crimes, then making them feel like they can help catch the perpetrators. Along the way, the network says, they may even learn to avoid becoming victims. Investigation Discovery's lineup includes a slew of shows that prey on women's fears of murderous husbands or mystery assailants out to abduct them or their children. ...

Allison Coss and Scott Sippola were convicted in 2010 of concocting an elaborate plot to extort money from Stamos by threatening to release pictures of him at a party where there were strippers and cocaine. The defendants were each sentenced to four years in prison. Coss and Sippola challenged their convictions, claiming the extortion law was vague and therefore unconstitutional. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Roger Ailes takes dig at Soledad O'Brien's name</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Roger Ailes probably should probably hire a new joke writer. The Fox News president made headlines Friday after taking an inexplicable -- and not particularly witty -- dig at CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien. The comment came during an appearance at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday. Ailes was on campus as part of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication's Roy H. Park Distinguished Lecture Series, but one particular comment from Ailes wasn't particularly distinguished at all. ...

     <title>&quot;Flintstones&quot; reboot put on indefinite hold</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Sorry, Seth MacFarlane fans: when it comes to his planned &quot;Flintstones&quot; reboot, the operative phrase is now, &quot;Yabba Dabba Don't.&quot; The revamp of the classic cartoon about a prehistoric working schlub and his family, which was to air on Fox, has been put on ice indefinitely, due to schedule concerns on MacFarlane's part. Fox announced the series last May with a plan to premiere the new &quot;Flintstones&quot; in 2013. Though the news may disappoint, it's hardly surprising that MacFarlane should find his plate too full. ...

Baldwin tweets that crews from both organizations -- and others -- have been camped outside his Greenwich Village home in New York City. It is the same home where the Canadian woman, Genevieve Sabourin, appeared over the weekend, prompting him to call police. &quot;Outside my apt, &quot;journalists&quot; from the Post camped out to talk to me about stalking,&quot; he wrote late Tuesday. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
