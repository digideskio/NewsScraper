     <title>College exams work to deter cheating; problems abroad</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - College admissions officers on Wednesday welcomed new rules aimed at deterring cheating on entrance exams, but continued to raise concerns about fraud, especially among foreign applicants. The new regulations require students taking the SAT and ACT, the two most widely used college entrance exams in the United States, to provide a photo of themselves when they register. Test proctors will be asked to check those photos against identification cards students present when they check in for the exams - and against the students themselves. ...

     <title>Mayor Emanuel, CPS Agree to Scale Back Longer School Day</title>
     <description>
      According to CBS Chicago, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office announced today he and Chicago Public Schools CEO Jean-Claude Brizard have agreed to shorten the proposed longer school day for elementary students. The initial plan was to keep all students in class for 7 1/2 hours a day but now only high school students will be kept in class for that long. Elementary students will see their school day shortened to seven hours a day. The changes were made after Mayor Emanuel met with parent groups.

     <description>
      Activist Ralph Nader has written an open letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook urging the company to refuse the nearly $30 million in Texan taxpayer money already pledged to lure the company to&nbsp;build&nbsp;a $304 million campus in Austin.The money is nothing compared to Apple's enormous profits, Nader says, but would mean a lot to Texas public schools.

      Astronauts who go heavy on the hot sauce may welcome a less-messy space food idea from four high school students.

     <title>No Child Left Behind Increases Gap in Arts Education</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | A recent report by the National Center for Education Statistics comparing changes in arts education in public schools from 1999-2000 to 2009-2010 shows that since the start of No Child Left Behind, our public schools have seen a reduction in the arts education offered to students. Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, commented on the results, stating it is imperative that &quot;we continue to elevate, enrich, and expand arts education in our nation's schools&quot;, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
