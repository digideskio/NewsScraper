      Jackson Diehl in The Washington Post on Obama's delay tactics &quot;Wherever war rages, crisis looms, or a truculent strongman glowers, the message from the White House has been the same: 'Give me space,'&quot; writes Diehl. Obama said those words to President Medvedev of Russia, explaining that his ability to negotiate in an election year is hampered. And Diehl describes Obama's stalling tactics in a range of conflicts, from Syria to Israel to North Korea. ...

     <title>What Happens in Colombia ... Is Pretty Embarrassing for the Secret Service</title>
     <description>
      Any longheld suspicions that Secret Service agents are actually perfect, Terminator-issue cyborgs manufactured in the bowels of The White House came to an abrupt end this weekend when word spread that 11 of their earbud-monitoring ranks have been placed on administrative leave. The 11 men stand accused of &quot;drinking excessively&quot; and &quot;cavorting with prostitutes&quot; while at the Hotel Caribe in Cartagena, Colombia, stationed there ahead of the president's diplomatic visit to the country.&nbsp;

     <title>Biography Must Take Back Seat in 2012 Presidential Election</title>
     <description>
      Biography no longer seems to matter much in American politics. There was a time when a candidate's story was everything and legions of hickory-tough old generals, backwoods rail splitters and celebrated Rough Riders soared into the White House on the wings of their modest roots and past accomplishments. But in the frenetic buzzing of today's politics, the personal story has become easy prey to a million tiny bites. Mitt Romney would be wise to consider this as he turns to face the general election.

On a three-day visit to Colombia for a summit with Latin American leaders, Obama is hoping to court Hispanic voters back home whose support could be crucial to him in the November 6 election. The Democratic president wants to fight an impression that he has neglected Latin America and failed to push hard enough on comprehensive immigration reform. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
