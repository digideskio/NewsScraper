Gross earnings rose to 104.83 billion naira for 2011, from 83.97 billion in 2010, the bank said in a statement through the Nigerian Stock Exchange. It did not explain the fall in profit despite rising revenues, but a number of Nigerian banks have issued disappointing results for 2011 because of write downs of non-performing loans left over from a 2008/9 banking crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Nigeria banking crisis over, says state &quot;bad bank&quot;</title>
     <description>
      LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's banking crisis is over and the sector's earnings should see a substantial recovery when results come in for the first quarter of 2012, the chief executive of state-owned &quot;bad bank&quot; AMCON said on Monday. AMCON was set up in 2010 to clean up the banking system in Africa's most populous country following a $4 billion rescue of nine lenders that came close to collapse. ...

     <title>Wall Street opens higher as banks lead</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street opened higher on Monday as U.S. retail sales in March eased concerns about a slowing economic recovery and Citigroup earnings helped lift bank shares. The gains in the benchmark S&amp;P index come on the heels of a 2-percent drop last week and a 2.7 percent loss over the prior two weeks, its worst two-week slide since November, on increasing concerns about the euro-zone debt crisis and weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data. Citigroup Inc advanced 2.9 percent to $34.37 after posting a first-quarter profit that topped Wall Street expectations. ...

     <title>Miners' rebound helps European shares advance</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - European shares advanced on Monday, with a strong start to the U.S. earnings season helping them consolidate after recent falls even as investors remained cautious about the outlook for Spain ahead of a bond auction this week. The FTSEurofirst 300 was up 3.93 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,031.66 by 0852 GMT, having closed down 1.6 percent on Friday, which took its weekly drop to 2.3 percent and saw it chalk up a fourth consecutive weekly loss.
