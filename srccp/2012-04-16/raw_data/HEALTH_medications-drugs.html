     <title>Spinal injections may not aid lower back pain</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new study suggests that injections of steroids or arthritis drugs in the spine may not provide much extra relief for people with chronic back and leg pain due to nerve damage. The drug injections also didn't increase the risk of infection and other complications, despite some previous safety concerns. It's possible, researchers said, that higher doses of steroids or the anti-arthritis drug etanercept (marketed as Enbrel) may do a better job of easing pain in this notoriously hard-to-treat group of patients. ...

      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - One in 16 Oregon youths say they have played a dangerous game in which they get high by putting pressure on the neck to cut off blood circulation to the brain, U.S. researchers said on Monday. The study was led by public health officials in Oregon and did not look at the extent of the problem nationwide. But the researchers said there is no reason to think the results would be significantly different elsewhere in the United States. ...

     <title>One in 16 youth play the &quot;choking game:&quot; study</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In a 2009 survey of eighth graders in Oregon, one in 16 said they had participated in the &quot;choking game,&quot; according to research published Monday. The game -- a misnomer because of its risks, researchers say -- involves putting pressure on the neck with a towel or belt to cut off someone's oxygen supply, then releasing the pressure to give a &quot;high&quot; sensation. The one-in-16 figure is in line with research from elsewhere in the United States and in other countries where youth are known to play the choking game, according to Dr. ...

     <title>Turmeric extract may protect heart after surgery: study</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Extracts from turmeric spice, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, may help ward off heart attacks in people who have had recent bypass surgery, according to a study from Thailand. During bypass surgery the heart muscle can be damaged by prolonged lack of blood flow, increasing the patient's risk of heart attack. But the new findings, published in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Cardiology, suggest that curcumins - the yellow pigment in turmeric - may ease those risks when added to traditional drug treatment. ...
