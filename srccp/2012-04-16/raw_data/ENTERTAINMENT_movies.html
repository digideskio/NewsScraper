Allison Coss and Scott Sippola were convicted in 2010 of concocting an elaborate plot to extort money from Stamos by threatening to release pictures of him at a party where there were strippers and cocaine. The defendants were each sentenced to four years in prison. Coss and Sippola, who were in a relationship at the time, challenged their convictions, claiming the extortion law was vague and therefore unconstitutional. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>&quot;Spider-man&quot; trailer has more lizard, daddy issues</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Peter Parker has a whole lot of daddy issues and a scaly, slithering, super-freaky villain to deal with in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man.&quot; That's the take-away from a new international trailer for the upcoming reboot of Sony's superhero franchise. The latest preview gives audiences a more extensive look at Rhys Ifans' villainous Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard, who is big, green and administering a smack-down on Manhattan motorists. This reptilian baddie has serious road-rage. It also appears that the orphaned Peter's father had some kind of business association with Connors. ...

     <title>3D 'Titanic' posts China's best box office bow ever</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap) - The 3D re-release of &quot;Titanic&quot; recorded the best box office opening ever in China this weekend, claiming $58 million for international distributor Fox. Universal got some good news, too. It opened its pricey &quot;Battleship&quot; in 26 territories - not including China - and took in $58 million. That represents a pretty good payoff on the studio's early overseas opening strategy. The movie will roll out in the U.S. on May 18. The huge China opening for &quot;Titanic&quot; and receipts from 69 other territories upped the global haul in its second overseas weekend to $88.2 million. ...

     <title>James Bond stuntman crashes in Istanbul bazaar</title>
     <description>
      ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A stuntman in the new James Bond film &quot;Skyfall&quot; now shooting in Istanbul lost control of his motorcycle and smashed into the window of a 330-year-old shop in the city's 15th-century Grand Bazaar, Turkish media said on Monday. The stuntman swerved to avoid hitting extras while careering through the Grand Bazaar at high speed, the NTV news channel said, but then crashed into the jewellery shop and smashed its crystal glass window. &quot;It is very nice for the Grand Bazaar to be chosen as a location for shooting this kind of movie. But the bazaar's administration ... ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - DreamWorks is preparing pink slips as it scales back production, an individual with knowledge of the situation told TheWrap. The individual said the boutique studio is preparing to lay off roughly 10 percent of its 80-person workforce in the next few days. As part of the downsizing, Steve Molen has resigned as head of physical production. He is not expected to be replaced. A DreamWorks spokesperson declined to comment on any possible layoffs, but said, &quot;Like every other business we're always focused on allocating our resources to address the company's evolving ...

The &quot;Golden Girls&quot; icon, who turned 90 years young in January, launched her official Twitter account Tuesday, offering an adoring public a glimpse into the still-spry actress' fertile mind, 140 characters at a time. The actress's maiden tweet was a typical bit of witticism (or is that White-icism?) designed to enchant and delight the masses. &quot;Hello Twitter! And they said it would never happen. Oh wait, that was me,&quot; White cracked. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The movie is a behind-the-scenes look at how Walt Disney was able to convince&nbsp;P.L. Travers to let his studio adapt &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; for the big screen. The result, of course, was an Oscar-winning film that made Julie Andrews a movie star and in many ways surpassed the fame of Travers' book. However, it was an enjoyable confection that Travers hated. Hanks would play Disney, while Thompson is being eyed for Travers. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The movie is a behind-the-scenes look at how Walt Disney was able to convince&nbsp;P.L. Travers to let his studio adapt &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; for the big screen. The result, of course, was an Oscar-winning film that made Julie Andrews a movie star and in many ways surpassed the fame of Travers' book. However, it was an enjoyable confection that Travers hated. Hanks would play Disney, while Thompson is being eyed for Travers. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
