     <title>Decline in Kids' Deaths Shows Modern Safety Measures Really Work</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | I was out of a car seat by the time I could walk. I never had a booster seat. I rode my bike without a helmet, rode shotgun well before I could see over the dashboard, and never once owned or used a pair of knee pads. Most adults grew up the way I did, with more laissez-faire attitudes toward kids' safety -- and most of us survived to adulthood just fine. But, while many of us dismiss today's stringent safety measures for kids as unnecessary, the proof of their efficacy is in the pudding. ...

     <title>Fox News Mole Joe Muto and Gawker: More Hype Than Substance</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | &quot;Fox News mole&quot; Joe Muto, believes his career in cable news is over after being caught leaking information to Gawker, according to The Cutline. As a political/business consultant, I do not see Muto as a threat to the news organization. I see his story being more hype than substance and about to act as a lesson to other potential corporate and political moles.

     <title>Feeding Tube Diet? Irresponsible Doctors Condone Anorexia</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Our country's relationship with food is perhaps the most paradoxical and irrational in the world. We boast not only the world's highest levels of obesity, but also the highest levels of deadly eating disorders such as anorexia. Disturbingly, many licensed, practicing physicians actually condone and support eating disorders. One such physician is Florida's Dr. Oliver R. Di Pietro, who encourages his patients to &quot;eat&quot; only through a feeding tube in order to shed vanity pounds.

     <title>OWS is in the Midst of an Identity Crisis</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Occupy Wall Street socialist agitators are fighting among themselves, proving again that unchecked liberalism will always foster pandemonium and failure. Portions of the political movement want to be Barack Obama campaign cheerleaders, while others are fearful of being linked with the &quot;old left&quot; and &quot;impotent&quot; Democratic establishment, according to The Blaze. Apparently the traditional Democratic Party has not swung far enough to the left to suit diehard OWS organizers.

As a political consultant, I can see the number of scandals and scandal investigations tied to President Obama skyrocketing in the months leading to the election due to boredom.

     <title>OWS Protestors Are Becoming Violent</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | If you do not agree with a law, rule or even an order by your boss, kick in a few windows to make your point. Just make sure you wear a mask and black clothing so you are harder to identify. Such criminal activity is becoming a standard tactic for Occupy Wall Street protestors. Last week New York protestors vandalized businesses in what was termed a &quot;black bloc&quot; attack, according to The Blaze. In addition to smashing storefront windows while staff and patrons cowered beneath tables, a police officer was attacked with a metal pipe.

     <title>Tornado Survivor Vainly Claims God Saved Him</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Paul Lord is a very lucky guy. He didn't win millions in a lottery, however. He survived a tornado that took the lives of five people, including two children, according to CNN. The report talks about how thankful Lord is for his survival. Being happy to dodge a bullet is understandable. The first quote the report attributes to Lord is a message of gratitude to God, saying, &quot;We are truly blessed. God saved us, and that's what it's about.&quot; That's a load of baloney for several reasons.

     <title>Craigslist Murder Suspect Deserves to Be Tried as an Adult</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | When violent crimes are committed by teenagers it is often difficult what leads such young Americans to commit gruesome acts. The Ohio Craigslist murder trial is but one example of teen crime with potential adult consequences. Alleged murderer Brogan Rafferty agreed to waive his right to a hearing that would have allowed him to fight adult felony charges, according to the Associated Press. The 17-year-old deserves to be tried as an adult for the role he allegedly played in the shooting deaths of three men in a rural Akron-area field.

     <title>Scott Brown Doesn't Tell the Whole Truth About Corporate Taxes</title>

      COMMENTARY | Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., wrote an op-ed for the Boston Herald, just in time for Tax Day. He decries the high tax burden and says American families have had to make do with less. Congress should, too, but not corporations. Our corporate tax rate is the highest in the world. &quot;That's shameful,&quot; he writes. &quot;Letting businesses and people keep more of what they earn will create jobs and help our economy grow.&quot; Typical Republican talking point.
