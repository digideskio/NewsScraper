     <title>Sleepy Air Canada pilot thought Venus was a plane</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - A sleepy Air Canada pilot first mistook the planet Venus for an aircraft, and then sent his airliner diving toward the Atlantic to prevent an imaginary collision with another plane, an official report said on Monday. Sixteen passengers and crew were hurt in the January 2011 incident, when the first officer rammed the control stick forward to avoid a U.S. plane he wrongly thought was heading straight toward him. ...

They will apply to full-size pickups, heavy trucks and buses as well as to cement, garbage and dump trucks. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      (Reuters) - When Travis Howard started his degree at the Colorado School of Mines four years ago he decided to pursue a double major in mechanical engineering and metallurgy to give himself the best chance of landing a high-paying job when he graduated. Turns out he had nothing to worry about. The 21-year-old, who dropped his mechanical classes to focus on mining after his second year, has accepted a job with Kinross Gold Corp at a starting salary of $64,000 a year plus bonuses. ...

      OTTAWA (Reuters) - Defense chiefs from eight Arctic nations agreed on Friday to cooperate more closely to deal with disasters and search and rescue operations in the remote resource-rich region, Canada's top soldier said.

The Canada Industrial Relations Board ordered the Air Canada Pilots Association (ACPA) &quot;to take all reasonable steps to bring to an end the illegal strike&quot; and to require all participating pilots to &quot;immediately return to work,&quot; the carrier said late Friday. Air Canada canceled about 75 flights on Friday because of an &quot;illegal job action&quot; by some of its pilots, the airline said in a statement. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Canada regulators impose tough rules on &quot;dark&quot; trades</title>
     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's securities watchdogs unveiled strict rules on Friday for anonymous stock trades in so-called &quot;dark pools,&quot; a move the regulators said was aimed at protecting investors from the risk of unfair pricing. Dark pools allow some players, often big institutions, to match orders while concealing price and volume. By enabling them to hide their cards, the dark pools limit the impact of an order on the stock's price before the trade's completion. ...
