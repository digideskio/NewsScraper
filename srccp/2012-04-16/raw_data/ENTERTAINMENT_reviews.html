His newest book begins where the first left off with a new goal of 90 days. But this time around, Clegg is not out to kill himself with endless sleep-deprived, paranoid nights on cocaine. Instead, it's an account of getting sober and a journey of relapse and recovery. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Whedon's script (co-written with director Drew Goddard) contains such delicious twists and turns, however, that it's hard to discuss the film without spoiling the fun for uninitiated viewers. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Book Talk: Deceit and espionage in darkest Luxembourg</title>
     <description>
      TOKYO (Reuters) - The worst thing about Kate's life in Luxembourg as the trailing spouse of a man hired to work on banking security at first simply appears to be the boredom of spending days among fellow housewives after giving up her career. But Kate, the heroine of Chris Pavone's debut novel &quot;The Expats,&quot; is a former CIA agent who has never told her husband what she did. As she seeks both to escape her past deeds and become a new person, she starts to become suspicious not only of her husband Dexter's doings but those of a couple whose friendliness may not be quite what it seems. ...

Written by Laura Lau and directed by Lau and Chris Kentis (the married couple's previous film was &quot;Open Water&quot;), this low-budget indie is filmed in a series of extended takes. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>S&amp;P: China developers getting closer to &quot;downgrade thresholds&quot;</title>
     <description>
      HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tough operating conditions and heightened refinancing risks in China's property market are pushing more developers closer to their downgrade thresholds, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said in a report on Thursday. In the report titled &quot;The Worst Is Yet To Come For Chinese Developers In Asia's Shaky Property Sector,&quot; S&amp;P warned that more credit downgrades are likely in the next six months. &quot;Many developers in China may be at increased risk of refinancing due to weaker property sales, high funding costs, and tightened liquidity. ...

     <title>Tim and Eric's &quot;Billion Dollar Movie&quot; worth about 15 cents</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - What's funny to one person is just a prolonged poop joke to another person. Not that there's anything wrong with scatological humor. &quot;Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie&quot; is full of it. Literally. The film, already available free on cable and opening theatrically on Friday, is going to appeal to a very limited audience. But for those on its wavelength -- I'm guessing mostly men, mostly younger -- it hits all of their requisite stations of the comedy cross. Joke about masturbation? Check. ...

All sorts of things can, and do, go bump in the night. Horror films like &quot;Silent House&quot; exploit the thin line -- at least for suggestible and susceptible viewers -- between creaky and creepy. &quot;Silent House,&quot; which is based on &quot;La Casa Muda,&quot; a 2010 Uruguayan film, does creepy with artistic pretentions. Written by Laura Lau and directed by Lau and Chris Kentis (the married couple's previous film was &quot;Open Water&quot;), this low-budget indie is filmed in a series of extended takes. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>&quot;Awake&quot; Is the Best New Show of the Season</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - &quot;Awake&quot; is the best new show of the season. It isn't perfect. The NBC drama, debuting tonight, will confuse and perhaps occasionally bore you. But despite the most complicated narrative since ABC's &quot;Lost&quot; kept skipping through time, &quot;Awake&quot; makes a fast, emotional connection that gives viewers an almost immediate stake in the lives of its compelling characters. The basic setup is this: LAPD Det. Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) is in a horrible car accident with his wife and son. It breaks his life in two. ...
