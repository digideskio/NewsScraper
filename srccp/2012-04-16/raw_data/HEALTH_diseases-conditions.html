     <title>Spinal injections may not aid lower back pain</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new study suggests that injections of steroids or arthritis drugs in the spine may not provide much extra relief for people with chronic back and leg pain due to nerve damage. The drug injections also didn't increase the risk of infection and other complications, despite some previous safety concerns. It's possible, researchers said, that higher doses of steroids or the anti-arthritis drug etanercept (marketed as Enbrel) may do a better job of easing pain in this notoriously hard-to-treat group of patients. ...

     <title>Perceptions of cancer care may not match reality</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In a new study, the impressions of breast cancer patients about the quality of care they received often differed from medical definitions of quality -- in part because the patients were judging their experiences by a different set of standards. Patient perceptions are increasingly important to hospitals and other healthcare providers that find their payments from insurers and the government tied to performance and patient evaluations. ...

      (Reuters) - Women who have early breast tumors surgically removed may often go through repeat mammograms and invasive procedures for years afterwards, with two-thirds having at least one more invasive procedure over the next decade, according to a U.S. study. The study, which covered nearly 3,000 women, focused on so-called ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS - abnormal cells in the milk ducts that are considered the earliest stage of breast cancer. The most common treatment involves removing only the abnormal tissue and conserves the breast. ...
