The lawsuit filed by a group of Planned Parenthood clinics that do not provide abortions says the rule is unconstitutional and that it will lead to tens of thousands of women being unable to get preventive healthcare from their chosen provider. ...

All common birth control pills increase a woman's chances of getting potentially fatal blood clots. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that some studies showed the danger may be even higher for more recent pills that contain the compound drospirenone, a synthetic hormone. ...

     <title>Sex education stagnating in U.S. schools, CDC says</title>
     <description>
      ATLANTA (Reuters) - Public schools in the United States are making &quot;little progress&quot; in expanding instruction in how to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV, a new federal study concluded. Between 2008 and 2010, the percentage of public schools teaching key topics on prevention did not increase in the 45 states surveyed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In middle schools, 11 states saw declines during the two-year period and no state saw an increase, the CDC said. The level of instruction was stable in high schools. ...

     <title>Genital warts tied to range of cancers</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People who've ever had genital warts may have a somewhat higher risk of several types of cancer -- possibly including common skin cancers, a new study suggests. The findings, reported in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, confirm some well-established connections between the genital warts virus and certain cancers. And they hint that there could be additional risks. Genital warts are caused by certain strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV). It's well known that some of those HPV strains -- some of which are the focus of vaccines -- can also promote tumors. ...

      (Reuters) - Xavier University, one of the oldest Roman Catholic colleges in the United States, will cut off birth-control coverage for its employees in July, a move that has divided faculty members and students on the Cincinnati campus.

     <title>GSK's new once-daily HIV drug matches Merck rival</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - A new once-daily AIDS drug from GlaxoSmithKline and its partner Shionogi proved just as good as Merck &amp; Co's twice-daily rival Isentress in a late-stage clinical trial, boosting hopes for the product. Both GSK's new drug dolutegravir and Isentress are so-called integrase inhibitors, a novel class of drugs for fighting HIV/AIDS that block the virus causing the disease from entering cells. Dolutegravir is important for GSK since it could help rejuvenate its HIV/AIDS business - an area of medicine it used to dominate but where it has fallen behind rivals in recent years. ...
