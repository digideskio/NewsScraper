     <description>

     <title>Public Doubts Congress Can Get Jobs Policy Done</title>
     <description>
      Most Americans think it is very important for Congress to address the nation’s job situation and reduce the federal budget deficit over the next year, but they remain pessimistic that President Obama and the legislative branch will agree on those issues, according to a new United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll that also reveals a pervading and continuing distrust of Washington since last summer’s debt-ceiling debacle.

     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Obama administration's top cyber security official says companies would not be unduly burdened by a Senate bill that would phase in security standards for key parts of the country's privately held infrastructure.
