With Jennifer Lopez leading the way, fellow judges Randy Jackson and Steven Tyler stormed the stage and announced they were using their only &quot;save&quot; to keep Sanchez on the show shortly after Sanchez was told she had received the fewest fan votes this week. &quot;Give me that mic!,&quot; Lopez exclaimed as she rushed up to Sanchez. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Buzz was running high ahead of the rap duo's headlining appearance, with rumors rife about potential surprise guests, as well as a hologram resurrecting late rappers Tupac Shakur and Nate Dogg, that are thought to be joining the pair for their hit, &quot;California Love. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Deal reached on royalty rates for digital music</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - Several of the music industry's largest trade groups on Wednesday reached an agreement on royalty rates for licensing music to online music services like iTunes Match. Ever since the dawn of digital music, the industry has not only had to grapple with how to control the illegal spread of its content - curbing piracy - but also how to properly charge for its distribution on legal services. It is of growing importance now that more than 50 percent of the music market's value comes from digital sales. That is what this agreement tries to resolve. ...

Obama, who famously called &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; rapper West &quot;a jackass&quot; after West hijacked Taylor Swift's acceptance speech at the Video Music Awards, re-affirmed that opinion during an interview with the Atlantic. Asked by the interviewer -- who will surely receive a Pulitzer for this -- whether he prefers West or his fellow rapper/recent collaborator Jay-Z, Obama answered, &quot;Jay-Z ... although I do like Kanye. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Obama, who famously called &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; rapper West &quot;a jackass&quot; after West hijacked Taylor Swift's acceptance speech at the Video Music Awards, re-affirmed that opinion during an interview with the Atlantic. Asked by the interviewer -- who will surely receive a Pulitzer for this -- whether he prefers West or his fellow rapper/recent collaborator Jay-Z, Obama answered, &quot;Jay-Z ... although I do like Kanye. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

It's as if the very picture of ‘90s adolescence skipped directly to middle-age while we weren't looking. The stage is set in her seventh album with a spoken-word intro that has Monica talking on the phone with Mary J. Blige (whose part sounds to have been lifted off a voicemail). ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
