     <title>First Person: The 6-Step Retirement Plan</title>
     <description>
      Most of us know that we should have some sort of retirement plan in place, but actually having one might be something else altogether. Personally, I've had a retirement plan of sorts in the works since I graduated from college. And while this plan has changed and evolved over the years, the end-goal -- retiring at a reasonable age and in a financial situation that allows for comfort and security -- has remained the same.

     <title>How Baby Boomers are Picking a Retirement Age</title>
     <description>
      Baby boomers have a variety of ways of deciding when they are ready for retirement. Almost half (45 percent) of the oldest baby boomers have already retired, according to a recent GfK Custom Research North America survey commissioned by the MetLife Mature Market Institute. The telephone survey of 1,012 people born in 1946 found that only about a quarter (24 percent) of these baby boomers are still employed full time, while the rest are working part time or seasonally, on disability, self-employed, or looking for work.

Some of the ideas might sound like &quot;Robo-Granny&quot;. An astronautical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has made a skin-tight undersuit equipped with sensors that can constantly monitor the vital signs of its elderly wearer and feed the data into a computer that fires off health alerts. It was first designed for a landing on Mars. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Already the cost of caring for aging baby boomers is beginning to strain government budgets, particularly in advanced economies where by 2050 the elderly will match the numbers of workers almost one for one.

     <title>First Person: Guarding Against Forced Retirement</title>
     <description>
      I subscribe to the belief that ages 40 and 50 are the new 30, as does my neighbor, a young-looking 50-something. But that sentiment came crashing down for him one day when a 20-something at work referred to him as the &quot;old guy.&quot; He swallowed his ego for that incident, but he now has a bug in his ear that his company might force him to retire because of age. After doing some research, I told my neighbor not to worry too much because there are laws regarding forced retirement.
