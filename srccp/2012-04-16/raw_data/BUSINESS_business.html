U.S. retail sales for March shot up 0.8 percent, sharply higher than the forecast, pushing Procter &amp; Gamble up 1.5 percent, while giving Wal-Mart Stores , the world's largest retailer, a 1.4 percent boost. But Apple shares dropped 4.2 percent to $580.13. After a meteoric rise of 43 percent this year, Apple was ripe for profit taking. Apple wasn't the market's only worry. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Although the unemployment rate slipped to a still high 8.2 percent in March, jobs growth slowed sharply, raising fears the labor market could start to sputter as it did a year ago. Nonfarm payroll employment rose by only 120,000 last month, roughly half the gains in each of the previous two months. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Strong retail sales ease growth worries</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans shrugged off high gasoline prices in March and spent more strongly than expected, suggesting economic growth in the first quarter was probably not as weak as many had feared. Retail sales increased 0.8 percent, the Commerce Department said on Monday, after rising 1.0 percent in February. Last month's gains handily beat economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent rise and indicated sturdy consumer spending in the first three months of 2012. Consumer spending accounts for more than two third of U.S. economic activity. ...

     <title>Fed tries to steer clear of controversial bond buys</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is independent but it does not exist in a vacuum, as waning appetite at the central bank for contentious bond purchases suggests. Minutes from the Fed's March meeting released this month showed support thinning for further bond purchases. Officials are unlikely to develop any more appetite for them by their meeting next week, despite disappointing March jobs figures. Policymakers have been heartened by patches of better economic data that raised hopes for solid growth this year, which helps explain their reticence toward further monetary ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Monday approved the country's first liquefied natural gas export plant in nearly 50 years, which will open up cheap and abundant American supplies to importers across the globe. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval paves the way for construction to begin at Cheniere Energy's LNG plant at Sabine Pass, Louisiana, which will chill natural gas to a liquid for shipping overseas by as early as 2015. It marks a huge turnaround for the U.S. ...

Altria's Philip Morris paid $3.5 billion, but the Marlboro-maker is disputing $206 million of that sum and has put that money in escrow. The national settlement, which involved most states, is designed to level the playing field between companies that signed it and those that did not. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>U.S. regulators approve Cheniere LNG export plant</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators granted Cheniere Energy approval on Monday to build an export plant for liquefied natural gas at Sabine Pass in Louisiana, the first project of its kind in the United States in 50 years. The approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) paves the way for construction to begin at Sabine Pass LNG, which Cheniere says could be ready by 2015. Cheniere will be able to export up to 2.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, the equivalent of 16 million tons per year (mtpa) of LNG, from Sabine Pass. ...

     <title>Boeing says production system was braced for tornado</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Monday its production system has a cushion in place to help absorb disruptions caused by a weekend tornado that hit Spirit AeroSystems , which makes its 737 fuselage and parts of other planes. Spirit, based in Wichita, Kansas, shut down temporarily after a tornado damaged roofs and cut power in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma on Saturday night. Spirit, Boeing's biggest supplier of structural components, said it did not yet know the full impact on production, but operations would be suspended at least through Tuesday and near-term deliveries would be affected. ...

It's not over yet, and it is going in the wrong direction,&quot; Soros said in discussion with Denmark's economics minister hosted by the daily newspaper Politiken. &quot;The euro is undermining the political cohesion of the European Union, and if it continues like that could even destroy the European Union,&quot; Soros said. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

It's not over yet, and it is going in the wrong direction,&quot; Soros said in discussion with Denmark's economics minister hosted by the daily newspaper Politiken. &quot;The euro is undermining the political cohesion of the European Union, and if it continues like that could even destroy the European Union,&quot; Soros said. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans square off this week over tax hikes for millionaires and tax cuts for businesses, with little expected to be accomplished beyond the winning of political points. Although chances are slim to none that any measure will become law ahead of the November 6 general election, the skirmishes will give voters a preview of debates they will hear over the next seven months. Obama and his fellow Democrats are arguing that raising taxes on the rich will help reduce deficits and bring more fairness to the tax code. ...

     <title>U.S. airlines seen posting Q1 loss, 2012 profit</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Rising fuel prices pushed major U.S. airlines into the red for the first quarter and could pressure results during the peak travel season, but most carriers are likely to be profitable this year, analysts said. While grappling with high fuel costs, carriers have merged, trimmed money-losing routes, raised ticket prices, and added charges for luggage and food to revive profits after the 2008-09 downturn. A rebound in corporate travel has bolstered the recovery. &quot;The question becomes how profitable&quot; will they be, said Savanthi Syth, an analyst with Raymond James. ...

Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto said the economy needs to grow at a faster rate in order to speed up the pace of employment growth and repair damage from the 2007-2009 recession, though she did not comment specifically on policy. ...

     <description>
      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Game publisher Electronic Arts Inc moved on Monday to squash rumors it will lay off between 500 and 1,000 employees in an attempt to cut costs and trim its headcount. John Reseburg, a company spokesman, acknowledged that E.A. is &quot;reshuffling&quot; its 9,000-strong worldwide work force, but dismissed Internet reports of the layoffs. &quot;I don't think there is a factual basis for the reports,&quot; Reseburg said. He added the company is expecting its headcount to be higher at the end of 2012 compared with last year. ...

     <title>Strong U.S. retail sales ease growth worries</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans shrugged off high gasoline prices in March and spent more strongly than expected, suggesting economic growth in the first quarter was probably not as weak as many had feared. Retail sales increased 0.8 percent, the Commerce Department said on Monday, after rising 1.0 percent in February. Last month's gains handily beat economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent rise and indicated sturdy consumer spending in the first three months of 2012. Consumer spending accounts for more than two third of U.S. economic activity. ...

     <title>Big Tobacco pays states $6.5 billion under accord</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - Three of the biggest U.S. tobacco companies said on Monday they have paid a total of $6.5 billion this year to U.S. states under a 1998 national accord that obliged companies to help cover the health bills of ailing smokers. Altria's Philip Morris paid $3.5 billion, said spokesman Steve Callahan. But the Marlboro-maker, which makes the biggest payments, is disputing $206 million of that sum, and has put that money in escrow. The national settlement that involved most states is designed to level the playing field between companies that signed it and those that did not. ...
