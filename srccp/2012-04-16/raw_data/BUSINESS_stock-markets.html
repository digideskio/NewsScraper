     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street opened higher on Monday as U.S. retail sales in March eased concerns about a slowing economic recovery and Citigroup earnings helped lift bank shares. The gains in the benchmark S&amp;P index come on the heels of a 2-percent drop last week and a 2.7 percent loss over the prior two weeks, its worst two-week slide since November, on increasing concerns about the euro-zone debt crisis and weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data. Citigroup Inc advanced 2.9 percent to $34.37 after posting a first-quarter profit that topped Wall Street expectations. ...

The results beat Wall Street expectations. Investment banking revenue rebounded from the 2011 fourth quarter as fears about the European debt crisis eased, prompting more companies and investors to return to fixed-income and equity markets. JPMorgan also got a boost from improvements in credit quality and loan demand - a trend seen in the performance of Wells Fargo &amp; Co as well. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
