     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials on Monday cited two health insurers for excessive premium increases, under consumer protection rules of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law that could soon be nullified by the Supreme Court. The Department of Health and Human Services called on Assurant Inc's Time Insurance Co and Bedford Park, Illinois-based United Security Life and Health Insurance Co to either offer rebates to customers in six states or rescind premium hikes ranging up to 24 percent. ...

     <title>Kris Kobach: Immigration isn't just a federal matter</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - The battle over illegal immigration heads to the U.S. Supreme Court next week, when the court will hear arguments for and against new Arizona laws requiring police, employers and landlords to expose undocumented immigrants. Arizona of course is not alone in its crackdown on illegal immigrants, with states including Alabama, Georgia, Utah, as well as a number of cities, passing similar measures. The movement's chief legal architect is 45-year old Kris Kobach, a former constitutional law professor, current secretary of state of Kansas and adviser to Mitt Romney on immigration issues. ...

The remote, verdant village of Totoral's bid to block Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista's huge Central Castilla power project on environmental grounds is now in the hands of the Supreme Court. ...

     <title>Breivik trial: Norwegians rethink role of psychiatry in courts</title>
     <description>
      In the first days after the twin terror attacks last year, Norway’s prime minister was quick to come out with a comforting message to the grieving nation. The country would respond to Anders Behring Breivik’s massacre with “more openness, more democracy,” said Jens Stoltenberg. This would not change&nbsp;Norwegian society.&nbsp;

     <title>Campaign 2012 and the War on Women</title>
     <description>
      Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday the &quot;war on women is real&quot; and will intensify as the next president makes Supreme Court nominations, Politico reported. U.S. News and World Report agrees that the political right is waging a war on women and that it is likely to have an impact at the polls. That publication says the war is evident from a review of legislation put forth by Republicans who came to power in 2010, including personhood amendments, ultrasound bills and efforts to criminalize birth control.

     <title>Judge to review moving hundreds of Madoff cases</title>

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the sprawling litigation to recover money related to Bernard Madoff's fraud, a federal judge said he would decide whether a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling prevents a bankruptcy court from resolving hundreds of lawsuits brought by the Madoff firm's trustee. Defendants in those cases have sought to transfer their cases to district court from bankruptcy court, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the estate of former Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith that limited the power of bankruptcy judges to review claims. In an order published Friday, U.S. ...

     <title>California Supreme Court Ruling: No Such Thing as Forced Lunch</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | The Associated Press provides some food for thought in discussing a recent ruling by the California Supreme Court that affirms the right of workers to work through lunch. Or, to be taken another way, affirms the right of employers to &quot;allow&quot; workers to toil over the mid-day breaks, with &quot;allow&quot; possibly running to gamut from subtle hints to explicit suggestions that workers keep toiling to get their tasks completed. What are some sensitive issues regarding a lunch break where a period of rest is not required?

     <title>Interim Mali leader promises vote, anti-rebel fight</title>
     <description>
      BAMAKO (Reuters) - Former parliament speaker Dioncounda Traore took over as Mali's interim president on Thursday from the leaders of last month's coup, promising to hold elections and fight rebels occupying half the country. Traore, 70, a labour activist turned politician, was sworn in by Supreme Court President Nouhoum Tapily in the capital Bamako as part of a deal to restore civilian rule after army officers staged a March 22 coup in the West African state.
