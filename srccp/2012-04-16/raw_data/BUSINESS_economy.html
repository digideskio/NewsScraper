     <title>'Captain America' costume grabs $228,000 at auction</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Captain America isn't just saving the nation from bad guys - the patriotic superhero is also apparently saving the country's auction houses from the still-grim economy. An auction of memorabilia from the 2011 film &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; and other big-screen Marvel offerings grossed $1.1 million over the weekend, with a costume from the film accounting for about a quarter of the haul. ...

     <title>Fed tries to steer clear of controversial bond buys</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is independent but it does not exist in a vacuum, as waning appetite at the central bank for contentious bond purchases suggests. Minutes from the Fed's March meeting released this month showed support thinning for further bond purchases. Officials are unlikely to develop any more appetite for them by their meeting next week, despite disappointing March jobs figures. Policymakers have been heartened by patches of better economic data that raised hopes for solid growth this year, which helps explain their reticence toward further monetary ...

Although the unemployment rate slipped to a still high 8.2 percent in March, jobs growth slowed sharply, raising fears the labor market could start to sputter as it did a year ago.

      TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto's main stock index paused on Monday after posting its seventh straight weekly loss in the last session, as concerns over Europe's debt crisis and slowing growth in China offset some better-than-expected U.S. economic data. Among the most influential decliners on the index, Barrick Gold fell 1.7 percent to C$40.79, Silver Wheaton tumbled 4.7 percent to C$29.67 and First Quantum Minerals lost 3.4 percent to C$20.88. ...

     <title>Strong retail sales ease growth worries</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans shrugged off high gasoline prices in March and spent more strongly than expected, suggesting economic growth in the first quarter was probably not as weak as many had feared. Retail sales increased 0.8 percent, the Commerce Department said on Monday, after rising 1.0 percent in February. Last month's gains handily beat economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent rise and indicated sturdy consumer spending in the first three months of 2012. Consumer spending accounts for more than two third of U.S. economic activity. ...

     <title>Fed taking on a lot of risk with bond buys: Bullard</title>
     <description>
      LOGAN, Utah (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is taking on a lot of inflation risk by purchasing bonds that expand its balance sheet, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Monday. &quot;I do think it's a risk and I do worry about it,&quot; he told students at the Utah State University Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, adding that inflation can be avoided if properly managed. The Fed's ultra easy policies in the last few years included some $2.3 trillion in asset purchases to kick-start the economic recovery, swelling the central bank's balance sheet to nearly $3 trillion. ...

     <title>Sudan parliament calls South an &quot;enemy&quot;</title>
     <description>
      KHARTOUM/JUBA (Reuters) - Sudan's parliament branded South Sudan an &quot;enemy&quot; on Monday and called for a swift recapture of a disputed oil-producing region, as rising border tensions pushed the old civil war foes closer to another full-blown conflict. South Sudan, which seceded from Sudan last July, seized the contested Heglig oilfield last Tuesday, prompting its northern neighbor to vow to recapture the area by &quot;all means&quot;. The oilfield is vital to Sudan's economy, producing about half of the 115,000 barrel-per-day output that remained in its control after South Sudan's secession. ...

      DJERBA, Tunisia (Reuters) - Algeria plans to boost investment in the tourism sector with the aim of attracting some 3.5 million tourists per year starting in 2015, the tourism minister said on Monday, in an effort to move its economy away from reliance on oil and gas. Though the North African country boasts unspoiled mountains, a long Mediterranean coastline and spectacular deserts, foreign visitors did not exceed 2 million last year, according to the minister. ...

     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans shrugged off high gasoline prices in March and spent more strongly than expected, suggesting economic growth in the first quarter was probably not as weak as many had feared. Retail sales increased 0.8 percent, the Commerce Department said on Monday, after rising 1.0 percent in February. Last month's gains handily beat economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent rise and indicated sturdy consumer spending in the first three months of 2012. Consumer spending accounts for more than two third of U.S. economic activity. ...
