      NEW YORK (Reuters) - As a former human rights lawyer and the author of non-fiction bestseller &quot;Stasiland&quot; about life in communist East Germany, Australian author Anna Funder knows a thing or two about digging deep to uncover the facts of history's fascinating stories. Yet she decided to make her second book, &quot;All That I Am,&quot; a novel when even her most meticulous historical research couldn't fill an important gap in the story of four friends forced to flee Germany when Hitler rose to power. She needed to know exactly what the characters in question thought and felt. ...
