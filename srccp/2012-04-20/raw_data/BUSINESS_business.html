A spike in bond yields has brought Europe's debt crisis back to the forefront. U.S. economic figures point to steady-but-uninspired growth, and stocks have backed off the sharp gains that recently pushed indexes to near four-year highs. Stocks returned a bit to their winning track this week after strong earnings reports, and investors are waiting to see if more positive surprises from U.S. companies are in store. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc's former chief executive Eric Schmidt received a bump in his annual salary to $1.25 million from the $1 he received in the previous year, after he became the executive chairman of the company in April 2011. Schmidt's total compensation last year swelled to $101 million thanks to a previously announced equity award granted when he ended a 10-year stint in the top job at Google, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. ...

The largest U.S. conglomerate said on Friday industrial orders had risen 20 percent in the quarter and that selling prices had improved in most of its businesses. This should help Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt achieve his goal of boosting profit margins this year. &quot;Global markets are improving, but volatility remains,&quot; Immelt told investors on a conference call. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The largest U.S. conglomerate said on Friday industrial orders had risen 20 percent in the quarter and that selling prices had improved in most of its businesses. This should help Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt achieve his goal of boosting profit margins this year. &quot;Global markets are improving, but volatility remains,&quot; Immelt told investors on a conference call. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Labor costs and the quality of goods are the top reasons for companies to consider so-called &quot;re-shoring,&quot; with some companies considering the United States a de facto low-cost country because of its high unemployment, according to the survey by the Boston Consulting Group.
