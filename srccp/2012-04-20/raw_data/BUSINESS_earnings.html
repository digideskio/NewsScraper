The Nasdaq Composite fell as SanDisk Corp led a drop in semiconductor shares with an 11.3 percent slide after its second revenue warning in as many quarters. Apple Inc's more than 2.4 percent fall also weighed, as shares continue to struggle ahead of earnings next week. Apple shares posted back-to-back weekly declines of more than 4 percent for the first time since late December 2008. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Wall St climbs after 2-day loss; euro rallies</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street rose on Friday after two days of losses as focus returned to better-than-expected first-quarter earnings in the United States and the euro and commodities gained on reduced worries over Spain's debt burden. U.S. Treasuries prices slid as traders pulled back from the recent rush into safe-havens. Some were also squaring positions as a cautionary step ahead of the French elections and next week's gatherings of key policymakers, including the U.S. Federal Reserve. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 was up half a percent at midday and headed for a 1. ...

     <title>Strong results at U.S. banks a good sign for Canada</title>
     <description>
      TORONTO (Reuters) - A strong first quarter for U.S. bank profits should bode well for Canadian lenders when they begin releasing their second-quarter results next month, an analyst said on Friday. The Canadian banks' second quarter runs from February to April, overlapping the final two months of the U.S. banks January-March quarter. &quot;While net interest margins remain under pressure amidst a persistent low interest rate environment, asset growth continues to hold steady, and credit quality remains a valuable earnings tailwind for the U.S. ...

      NEW YORK (Reuters) - A trio of large regional banks weighed in with earnings on Thursday that showed stronger credit quality and capital strength but few signs that their core businesses are improving due to low investment returns and weak loan demand. The banks are trying to offset declining income from low interest rates on loans and investments by cutting deposit rates and raising fees in order to widen profit margins. ...

McDonald's Corp climbed 1.8 percent to $96.97 as the top boost to the Dow after the world's biggest fast-food chain reported higher quarterly profit, paced by strong U.S. sales. Microsoft Corp gained 4.6 percent to $32.43 after profit beat expectations late Thursday as personal computer sales held up better than expected.

     <title>Instant View: General Electric posts quarterly profit</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - General Electric Co's first quarter earnings slightly beat Wall Street expectations, helped by strong sales of jet engines and energy equipment, as well as profit growth at its finance arm GE Capital. Profit excluding special items was 34 cents a share at the largest U.S. conglomerate, a penny above the average analyst forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 8.2 percent to $35.18 billion, due in part to the sale of NBC Universal, but beat Wall Street's expectation of $34.7 billion. GE shares rose 1 percent to $19.25 in premarket trading.. ...

      TOKYO (Reuters) - JFE Holdings Inc , the world's fifth-largest steelmaker, reported a 68 percent drop in full-year profit as a stronger yen squeezed export margins and product prices sagged.
