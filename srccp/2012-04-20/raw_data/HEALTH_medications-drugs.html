     <title>FDA says nanotech may need extra safety tests</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators said consumer products that use nanotechnology may have unknown effects on the human body, and advised food and cosmetic companies to further study the safety of these tiny particles. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued two draft guidelines on Friday calling for more studies, putting, for now, much of the onus for safety on companies. The FDA also rejected a consumer group's petition from 2006 that urged a separate category of regulation for nanotechnology due to its &quot;unique human health and environmental risks. ...

The study, of 218 women treated for early breast cancer, found that almost one-third had &quot;cancer-related fatigue&quot; at the end of treatment. But far fewer -- six percent -- still had the problem a year later. That suggests for most women with the disease post-treatment fatigue will fade with some time, the researchers report in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Statins don't reduce melanoma risk: study</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Despite earlier indications that people taking statins might have a reduced risk of developing melanoma, a large new study of women finds the popular cholesterol-lowering drugs do nothing to prevent the deadly skin cancer. &quot;For primary prevention (of melanoma) I think we're putting the nail into the coffin of that theory,&quot; said Dr. Robert Dellavalle, chief of dermatology at the Denver VA Medical Center, who was not involved in the new research. Melanoma is the most lethal of the skin cancers, with 70,000 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. ...

     <title>S.Africa's Aspen buys $263 mln of drugs from GSK</title>
     <description>
      LONDON/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Aspen Pharmacare will pay $263 million for GlaxoSmithKine Plc's international over-the-counter brands, the two companies said on Friday, giving the South African drug maker a stronger presence in popular painkillers. The sale is the latest move by GSK to fine-tune its consumer healthcare business and follows the divestment of other over-the-counter (OTC) brands in North America and Europe. Net cash proceeds from the transaction are expected to be approximately 135 million pounds and will be returned to GSK shareholders during 2012. Shares in Aspen closed 5. ...

      LONDON (Reuters) - SkyePharma said on Friday its lead product, asthma therapy Flutiform, had been recommended for approval by European regulators, doubling the value of the group's shares. Flutiform was referred to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) last year after member states could not reach unanimous agreement on the drug, which will compete with GlaxoSmithKline's Advair and AstraZeneca's Symbicort in the multi-billion dollar respiratory drugs market A positive opinion from the EMA is usually rubber stamped by the European Commission in a matter of months. ...

     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - European regulators recommended approval of a new type 2 diabetes drug from AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb on Friday, in a decision that contrasts starkly with its failure to win approval in the United States. Dapagliflozin, which will be sold under the brand name Forxiga, is a new type of diabetes drug designed to allow more sugar to be excreted with urine and has the potential to be the first to treat the disease independent of the hormone insulin. ...

Novartis said the decision meant the drug remained on-track to be a &quot;blockbuster&quot; - one with annual sales above $1 billion.

      LONDON (Reuters) - European regulators on Friday backed approval of a new diabetes drug from AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb that was rejected last year in the United States.

     <title>Novo Nordisk rejects diabetes drug Victoza complaint</title>
     <description>
      COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk rejected a consumer advocacy group's complaint about its big-selling diabetes drug Victoza as groundless and said it did not expect U.S. regulators to take any action. Its shares initially dropped more than 2 percent in brisk trade on Friday after non-profit group Public Citizen asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to withdraw approval of Victoza. Novo Nordisk, the world's biggest producer of insulin used to treat diabetes, was the most-traded stock on the Copenhagen bourse, with more than 350 million Danish crowns ($61. ...

And many times, there was little evidence the drugs would work. A medication is being used &quot;off label&quot; if a doctor prescribes it to treat a condition other than the one(s) Health Canada, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or similar national regulatory agencies approved it for based on tests of safety and efficacy.
