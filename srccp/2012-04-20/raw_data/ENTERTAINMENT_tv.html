I think musically, performance wise.. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

For the time being, at least, the newly rechristened Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists will have to go by its former name, the Screen Actors Guild, in a court battle with members protesting its recent merger.

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - RaeLynn of Team Blake and Ashley De La Rosa of Team Christina were sent home from popular TV singing competition &quot;The Voice&quot; on Tuesday night. Host Carson Daly pressed a hesitating coach Blake Shelton to choose between RaeLynn, who goes by her first name, and teammate Erin Willett as the show's credits began to role. After some hemming and hawing, country singer Shelton announced he was keeping Willett. Raelynn, who sang &quot;If I Die Young&quot; by The Band Perry, hugged Willett and appeared to tear up as the show ended. ...
