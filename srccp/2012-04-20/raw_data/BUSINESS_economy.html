The IMF's mission chief to Malawi, Tsidi Tsikata, told Reuters discussions on IMF support had begun on the sidelines of meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington.

Romney called for unity at a Republican National Committee conference in the Arizona desert that brought together party representatives from each state, some of whom had backed one of Romney's rivals for the nomination.

U.S. economic figures point to steady-but-uninspired growth, and stocks have backed off the sharp gains that recently pushed indexes to near four-year highs.

     <description>
      LUANDA (Reuters) - The European Union and Angola are close to signing a deal that will help the African country sustain its economic growth, boost good governance and fight poverty, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Friday. Barroso praised Angola's economic performance since the end of a long civil war a decade ago - mainly thanks to its position Africa's second-largest oil producer after Nigeria - but said it could benefit further from closer ties with the EU. ...

     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Pampered by a profligate state and blind to hard economic truths: that is how many French expatriates who have crossed the Channel to seek job opportunities in London view their compatriots back home as they prepare to elect their president. Dubbed &quot;Paris-on-Thames&quot; by some British media, London has an estimated 350,000 French residents scattered across the city and working in every sector from finance to fast food. It is the equivalent of France's fifth city after Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Toulouse, if you discount those cities' suburbs. ...
