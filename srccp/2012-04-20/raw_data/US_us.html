     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two women who said they were raped while attending U.S. military academies sued military officials on Friday, accusing them of failing to address widespread problems of sexual assault at the elite schools. In the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, the two women said the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland and the Army's United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, tolerate sexual assault and discourage victims of attacks from reporting them. ...

     <description>
      EDINBURG, Texas (Reuters) - Three people in Texas were arrested and charged with operating a cockfighting ring, a local sheriff said on Friday, a day after masked gunmen shot three people during a match. Investigators have not identified the gunmen who shot the spectators Thursday morning in a remote area about 20 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino said. Police arrested a man and woman who owned the land where an elaborate cockfighting ring operated for years, and the proprietor who rented the location, Trevino said. ...

With pension funding absorbing more and more of the state's budget, Quinn said his plan would save taxpayers $65 billion to $85 billion over 30 years and help stop a further fall in the state's relatively low credit ratings. Illinois' unfunded pension liability has grown to a huge $83 billion after the state skimped on funding for years. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      CHICAGO (Reuters) - Pastor Corey Brooks spent three winter months shivering atop the roof of a dilapidated Chicago motel to draw attention to the deadly toll from gun violence, raising $450,000 in the process to buy and raze the motel. &quot;It was tough to endure the cold, the nights and the loneliness,&quot; said Brooks, who came down on February 24 after 94 days spent in a tent staked to the roof of the Super Motel. &quot;But it was a blessing because it brought awareness to an issue, gun violence, where young men are killing each other. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Jefferson County and other Alabama local governments do not have to have bonds as debt to file for Chapter 9 federal bankruptcy, the state's top court said on Friday. In a 13-page opinion supporting Jefferson County, which last November filed the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy, the Alabama Supreme Court said another distressed local government, the City of Prichard, was eligible for Chapter 9 filing under Alabama law even though Prichard had no outstanding bonds. ...

     <title>&quot;Milestone&quot; oil manipulation case unsettles traders</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators' $14 million settlement with high-frequency trading firm Optiver over oil price manipulation in 2007 is a &quot;milestone&quot; victory in their toughening stance on market malfeasance which is being closely watched by traders. In its first major case against an algorithmic trader, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said late on Thursday that a court settlement required the Amsterdam-based firm to disgorge $1 million in profits and pay $13 million over allegations it used a rapid-fire tool nicknamed &quot;The Hammer&quot; to influence U.S. oil prices in 2007. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - A 28-year-old convicted killer who had abandoned his appeals process was executed in Delaware on Friday after a failed effort waged by federal public defenders to spare him, authorities said. Shannon Johnson, 28, died by lethal execution at 2:55 a.m., said Brian Selander, a spokesman for Governor Jack Markell. He is the fifteenth U.S. prisoner executed in 2012. By law, executions in Delaware must take place between 12:01 a.m. and 3 a.m. Inmates have the choice of hanging or lethal injection. Johnson's execution came after the U.S. ...

The previously undisclosed footage, obtained by a lawyer for the man's family in a wrongful-death suit brought against the U.S. government, appears in a Public Broadcasting Service television documentary set to air nationally on Friday night. ...

     <description>
      CHICAGO (Reuters) - Pastor Corey Brooks spent three winter months shivering atop the roof of a dilapidated Chicago motel to draw attention to the deadly toll from gun violence, raising $450,000 in the process to buy and raze the motel. &quot;It was tough to endure the cold, the nights and the loneliness,&quot; said Brooks, who came down on February 24 after 94 days spent in a tent staked to the roof of the Super Motel. &quot;But it was a blessing because it brought awareness to an issue, gun violence, where young men are killing each other. ...

     <title>University of Colorado clamps down on &quot;pot fest&quot;</title>
     <description>
      BOULDER, Colo. (Reuters) - The University of Colorado clamped down on a huge annual marijuana fest on Friday by restricting access to the school and a field where the &quot;smoke-in&quot; is traditionally held, and three protesters were arrested ahead of the event. The three young men were handcuffed and taken away after they crossed yellow police tape to stand in the field at the Boulder campus, holding signs that read: &quot;Have a happy 4/20/1984&quot; and &quot;A violation of 1st Amendment, the right to peaceably assemble. ...
