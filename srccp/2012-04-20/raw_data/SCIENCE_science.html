     <title>'Earliest Christian Artifact' Just Random Squiggles, Scholars Argue</title>
     <description>
      A 2,000-year-old box that is being lauded as the earliest Christian artifact ever found has been misconstrued, according to several scholars who were not involved in the box's discovery. They say the evidence of the box — engraved in Jerusalem mere decades after Jesus' death — being Christian is extremely frail, and a case of finding meaning in random squiggles.

     <title>Men Prefer Pink Female Genitals to Red, Study Finds</title>
     <description>
      Red lips, red hearts, red negligees — there's no doubt that red is a seductive color. A common explanation for the sexiness of red suggests that men are attracted to the color because it reminds them of genital arousal, much as the red swellings on female baboons' bottoms signal receptivity to male baboons.

Cowan worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory for nearly 40 years. He started in 1949 as a scientist and went on to serve as a director of chemistry and as associate lab director of research. Cowan was a chemist whose influence touched everything from the Manhattan Project and the hunt for evidence of the Soviet Union's first nuclear tests to the Santa Fe Institute and the iconic Santa Fe Opera. Cowan died Friday, April 20, 2012 at his home in Los Alamos, New Mexico. He was 92.
