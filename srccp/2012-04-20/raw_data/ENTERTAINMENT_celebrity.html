Whenever she smiled, cameras clicked and crowds roared with approval. She was just 14 at the time and apparently living the ultimate American dream. Or so it seemed. The medals, the cheesy grin, even the bear, were all just a mask for the demons she was battling. Privately, her life was starting to unravel. Her parents had just divorced and she did not know how to cope. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Rowling is working on a Harry Potter encyclopedia, and will donate the royalties to charity, she has said on her website. Four years ago the British writer took an independent U.S. publisher to court to stop its plans for a reference book on the world of the fictional boy wizard, saying it constituted a &quot;rip off&quot; of her work. On her re-vamped website, Rowling addressed the question of a Harry Potter encyclopedia in a &quot;frequently asked questions and rumors&quot; link. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Classically trained Canadian chef Douglas McNish was overweight and unhappy when he decided he needed to make a change in his life and his diet, and he hasn't looked back since.

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Thomas Kinkade, the self-styled &quot;Painter of Light&quot;, battled alcoholism for several years and had a relapse before he died unexpectedly last week, according to his brother. Patrick Kinkade told the San Jose Mercury News in an interview that a split with his wife, attacks on his work by art critics and financial troubles took their toll on his brother, and he turned to the bottle in the last four or five years. &quot;He would shoulder the world, pull the naysayers on his back and smile when he was doing it,&quot; Patrick Kinkade told the northern California newspaper. ...

     <title>&quot;Northeast Kingdom&quot; a treasure trove for writer</title>
     <description>
      TOKYO (Reuters) - The writer Howard Frank Mosher has lived for nearly half a century in such a remote part of the northern U.S. state of Vermont that Internet connections are very slow and even landline phone reception can be terrible at times. Yet the area known as the &quot;Northeast Kingdom&quot; - the three northeasternmost counties in the state - proved to be such a fertile source of inspiration that Mosher, born in 1942 and with 12 books behind him, has ended up spending most of his life there. ...

Thanks to social media, the remark quickly escalated into a fracas over the role of women in American society. It gave Mitt Romney, the likely Republican nominee for president who is scrambling to improve his ratings among women voters, a chance to reach out to them through his wife. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
