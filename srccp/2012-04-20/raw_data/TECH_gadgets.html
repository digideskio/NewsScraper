     <title>Apple Defends 4G Label on Australian iPad</title>
     <description>
      Responding to accusations that the new 4G-capable iPad is misleading because it doesn't connect to high-speed LTE networks in Australia, Apple shot back that the iPad is still 4G even if it can't do LTE Down Under.

The outsize influence of Apple on both the technology sector and the entire stock market was thrown into sharp relief when the iPad maker's shares fell 4.1 percent on Monday. The alpha male of the stock market, Apple accounts for a third of the S&amp;P tech sector's 20 percent year-to-date return, the best performance of any of the 10 sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index this year. The problem is, Apple's success may be masking a larger trend in the wider market toward slower profit growth. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The outsize influence of Apple on both the technology sector and the entire stock market was thrown into sharp relief when the iPad maker's shares fell 4.1 percent on Monday. The alpha male of the stock market, Apple accounts for a third of the S&amp;P tech sector's 20 percent year-to-date return, the best performance of any of the 10 sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index this year. The problem is, Apple's success may be masking a larger trend in the wider market toward slower profit growth. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>On the Call: Intel CEO Otellini talks tablets</title>
     <description>
      Intel Corp. is gearing up for its biggest marketing campaign in years, to support &quot;ultrabooks,&quot; which are thin, light laptops.
