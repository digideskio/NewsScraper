     <title>&quot;Five S's&quot; ease babies' pain during vaccinations</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Some physical comfort and a soothing voice may make routine vaccinations a little easier on babies without resorting to painkillers like acetaminophen, a new study suggests. It's no secret that vaccine jabs create distress, for infants and parents alike. The usual routine in pediatricians' offices is to get the shots done quickly and then pass the baby into mom's arms for some comfort.

     <title>Decline in Kids' Deaths Shows Modern Safety Measures Really Work</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | I was out of a car seat by the time I could walk. I never had a booster seat. I rode my bike without a helmet, rode shotgun well before I could see over the dashboard, and never once owned or used a pair of knee pads. Most adults grew up the way I did, with more laissez-faire attitudes toward kids' safety -- and most of us survived to adulthood just fine. But, while many of us dismiss today's stringent safety measures for kids as unnecessary, the proof of their efficacy is in the pudding. ...
