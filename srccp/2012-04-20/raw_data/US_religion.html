     <title>Vatican crackdown on U.S. nuns a long time brewing</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - When Pope John Paul II arrived in the United States in 1979, the president of the nation's most powerful organization of nuns met him with a challenge. In a bold welcoming address, Sister Theresa Kane called on the pope to include women &quot;in all ministries of our church,&quot; including the priesthood. The pope sat silent, his expression stony.

     <title>Vatican Criticizes U.S. Nuns for Being Too Progressive</title>
     <description>
      Apparently America's nuns are being way too lenient on gay rights, abortion, and women's ordination--which is why the Vatican reprimanded and ordered disciplinary action against the largest group and most influential group of Catholic nuns in the United States on Wednesday. The other offenses that the&nbsp;Leadership Conference of Women Religious, which represents most of the 55,000 Catholic nuns in the United States, has, in the Vatican's eyes, committed are &quot;radical feminist themes&nbsp;incompatible with the Catholic faith&quot; and supporting Obama's health care overhaul. ...

     <description>
      The Vatican orthodoxy watchdog announced Wednesday a full-scale overhaul of the largest umbrella group for nuns in the United States, accusing the group of taking positions that undermine Roman Catholic teaching on the priesthood and homosexuality while promoting &quot;certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith.&quot;
