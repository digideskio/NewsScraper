     <title>Facebook EnemyGraph App Might Do a Lot of Good</title>
     <description>

The service is similar to Apple’s offering but without any limitations on the type of content users can upload. The service&nbsp;is also expected to have access to popular TV shows, movies and music with free and paid content that will be available across a range of Samsung devices. The amount of storage allotted to users is rumored to be “more than 5GB,” although it isn’t clear if that will be free or is there is an associated charge.
