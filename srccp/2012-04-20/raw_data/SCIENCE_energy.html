     <title>Are Oil Speculators to Blame for High Gas Prices?</title>
     <description>
      President Barack Obama's targeting of oil speculators coincided with a Los Angeles Times report of a national average gasoline price of $3.92 per gallon. The president accused oil speculators of irresponsibility for the gasoline price increases that threaten the recovery. While there are several factors affecting the price of gas, oil speculators are an easy target. Public anger makes people more willing to blame them for the price increases.

     <description>
      President Obama is being lambasted by Republicans for not doing enough to lower gas prices. And that can hurt him politically because according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos online poll, 68 percent of Americans disapprove of how he’s handling gas prices.
