     <title>Nazi hunters ask Hungary to try 1944 war crimes suspect</title>
     <description>
      BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Nazi-hunters from the Simon Wiesenthal Center have named 95-year-old Hungarian Laszlo Csatary as their most wanted war crimes suspect and have asked Hungary to prosecute him, an expert at the center said on Friday. In its annual report this week, the center said that Csatary, who is accused of helping organize the deportation of about 15,700 Jews to the Auschwitz death camp from the Slovakian city of Kosice in 1944, had returned to Hungary from Canada. Csatary was the commander of police in Kosice, which was part of Hungary, during World War Two. ...

     <title>Canada rate hikes predicted despite tame inflation</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - A drop in Canada's year-on-year inflation rate to an 18-month low in March will not delay interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada, which is paying closer attention to economic growth, analysts said on Friday. Statistics Canada said the annual inflation rate fell to 1.9 percent in March from 2.6 percent in February, the lowest level since the 1.9 percent recorded in September 2010. Analysts had forecast a rate of 2.0 percent. The Bank of Canada, which targets a 2. ...

The Nasdaq Composite fell as SanDisk Corp led a drop in semiconductor shares with an 11.3 percent slide after its second revenue warning in as many quarters. Apple Inc's more than 2.4 percent fall also weighed, as shares continue to struggle ahead of earnings next week. Apple shares posted back-to-back weekly declines of more than 4 percent for the first time since late December 2008. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
