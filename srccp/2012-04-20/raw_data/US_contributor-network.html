     <title>Robot Prostitutes and the Future of Sex, Love</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | I suppose this really is the future I heard of as a kid. Perhaps I shouldn't be too surprised to see sex robots taking the place of prostitutes before the flying car goes mainstream.

The topic begs a number of questions, which perhaps only the biggest fans of Blade Runner could properly answer.

     <title>George Zimmerman Granted Bail; Is He in Danger?</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY| George Zimmerman has been $150,000 granted bail, paving the way for his release, as reported by the Associated Press. Prior to Zimmerman's bail, a new photograph of the back of Zimmerman's head was released. The image shows two gashes and blood flowing from the wounds in fingered rivers. The photograph was taken just minutes after Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin, says ABC Good Morning America.

     <title>Sarkozy Ramps Up Conservative Rhetoric Ahead of French Elections</title>
     <description>
      French President Nicolas Sarkozy railed against his opponents during campaign appearances on Thursday, saying that the results of the upcoming elections would &quot;teach all those people a lesson,&quot; according to Reuters. He also asserted that media reports predicting that he would lose his bid for a second term in office were determining the election's outcome before citizens had been given the chance to decide for themselves and cast their vote.

     <title>Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf May Seek Reorganization</title>
     <description>
      Speculation is rampant that the law firm of Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf LLP will soon file for bankruptcy protection and will quickly emerge as a new entity. Often, this is referred to as a prepackaged bankruptcy process, and the most famous case might be General Motors, which in 2009 was forced to declare bankruptcy and emerged a few days later, a leaner corporation with fewer brands and substantially fewer liabilities.

     <title>Rural Post Offices Need Saving, Senators Say</title>
     <description>
      It is no secret that the United States Postal Service is in trouble. The last year has been filled with talk of closing facilities and laying off personnel. While it is easy for big cities like New York or Chicago to consolidate offices, rural America will feel the absence of local post offices much harder.

     <title>Romney Attacks Obama's Economic Policies at Ohio Factory</title>
     <description>
      GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney spent a second day in Ohio on Thursday, stopping at a shuttered factory that then-Senator Barack Obama had visited during the 2008 presidential campaign, according to NPR. Both candidates have spent time in Ohio in the last few days, which is largely expected to be one of the influential swing states going into the November elections.

     <title>Obama Earned This Central Pennsylvanian's Vote with Stance on Women</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | This election season, I have no choice but to vote for President Barack Obama. My reason for voting for the incumbent hinges almost exclusively on one issue, as it likely will for others. My support for Obama is based mostly on the Republican candidates' harsh views on women's reproductive rights.

     <title>U.S. Military Gives Itself Another Black Eye</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | Early Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times published photographs of members of the 82nd Airborne posing with the mangled remains of suicide bombers and insurgents. An anonymous soldier from the division supplied the Times with 18 photographs taken in 2010.

      COMMENTARY | As the trial of accused mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik gets underway in Norway, another battle is being fought again -- the argument over whether violence in video games promotes violence in real life. The tragedy in Norway is being used to re-open the discussion and call for tighter regulation over video games development, according to a CNN report.

     <title>Soiled 6-Year-Old Proves We Accept Humiliation of Children</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | According to MSNBC, a 6-year-old girl at Southwest Elementary School in Washburn, Mo., was denied a bathroom break because she and her classmates were in the middle of taking a state standardized test. As a result, the poor kid soiled herself in diarrhea. Teachers did not try to clean her up. Instead, they gave her mother a trash bag to wrap around her child and take her home in.
