     <title>Value of Metformin, Insulin Combo for Type 2 Diabetes Questioned</title>
     <description>
      THURSDAY, April 19 (HealthDay News) -- It's not clear whether patients with type 2 diabetes gain any long-term benefit from taking the blood sugar-lowering drug metformin and insulin together rather than insulin alone.

     <title>EU agency endorses Bristol, Astra diabetes drug</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - European regulators on Friday backed approval of a new diabetes drug from AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb that was rejected last year in the United States. Dapagliflozin belongs to a new class of diabetes drugs designed to allow more sugar to be excreted with urine and has the potential to be the first to treat the disease independent of the hormone insulin. The European Medicines Agency also endorsed new drugs from Novartis and Takeda. (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; editing Kate Kelland)

     <title>Novo Nordisk rejects diabetes drug Victoza complaint</title>
     <description>
      COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk rejected a consumer advocacy group's complaint about its big-selling diabetes drug Victoza as groundless and said it did not expect U.S. regulators to take any action. Its shares initially dropped more than 2 percent in brisk trade on Friday after non-profit group Public Citizen asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to withdraw approval of Victoza. Novo Nordisk, the world's biggest producer of insulin used to treat diabetes, was the most-traded stock on the Copenhagen bourse, with more than 350 million Danish crowns ($61. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Watchdog group Public Citizen urged U.S. regulators to withdraw approval of Novo Nordisk's diabetes drug Victoza, saying it increases the risk of serious health problems like thyroid cancer and kidney failure. Public Citizen said the drug was approved in 2010 against the advice of three reviewers from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according a petition filed to the FDA on Thursday. &quot;The (approval) was a huge blow to the health and safety of diabetics in this country,&quot; said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, in an interview. ...

     <title>Value of screening for kidney disease unclear</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Screening people to catch early kidney disease may sound like a good idea, but there is no research to prove that it's worthwhile, according to a new review. In the U.S., about 11 percent of adults have chronic kidney disease, the vast majority of whom have early-stage disease. The disease is very common among older adults -- more than 44 percent of Americans older than 70 have it -- and high blood pressure and diabetes are the main risk factors. In its early stages, chronic kidney disease usually has no symptoms. ...

     <title>Do clean teeth protect against heart disease?</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Older adults who get thorough dental cleanings may be somewhat less likely to have a heart attack or stroke than their peers who are less careful about oral hygiene, a new study suggests. The study, of nearly 22,000 Taiwanese adults age 50 and up, found that those who'd had a professional tooth &quot;scaling&quot; in the past year were less likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke over the next seven years. Tooth scaling, sometimes called a deep cleaning, involves removing the &quot;plaques&quot; that can build up on the teeth and deep in tooth pockets within the gum line. ...

     <title>China study finds mine workers at higher risk of cancer, heart disease</title>

      HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese workers who are exposed to silica dust in mines, and pottery and gemstone factories suffer not only from respiratory illnesses, but are at higher risk of contracting heart and infectious diseases and cancer, researchers in China have found. Silica is a compound found in sand and rock. When rocks are drilled or broken, fine silica dust particles are produced that lodge deep in the lungs and can lead to scarring, severe respiratory problems and death. ...

     <title>My battle with breast cancer: Alternative medicine</title>
     <description>
      Alternative medicine is an important part of my cancer treatment.

My insurance covers some of the treatments. I do not get coverage for supplements that can be purchased over-the-counter.
