     <title>Animal sacrifice case underpins Guantanamo legal challenge</title>
     <description>
      MIAMI (Reuters) - A pending challenge to the jurisdiction of the Guantanamo war crimes tribunals relies in part on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right of Santeria priests in Florida to sacrifice chickens during religious ceremonies. The ruling was easily the most unusual cited last week in pretrial hearings for Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, a Saudi prisoner who could face the death penalty if convicted of orchestrating a suicide bomb attack that killed 17 U.S. sailors aboard the warship USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden. It was part of a larger defense argument that the U.S. ...

      PHOENIX (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday ruled Arizona may require voters to show identification at the polls, a ruling likely to add fuel to the fiery debate about voting rights in a presidential election year. But the court also ruled the state cannot demand that they show proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, a decision the state's attorney general said he would appeal. That could set the stage for yet another U.S. Supreme Court showdown over a contentious Arizona law touching on citizenship issues. ...

     <title>What does Caraco court win mean for generic drug companies?</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan had fun with semantics in Tuesday's unanimous ruling in the Caraco Pharmaceutical versus Novo Nordisk case in which pharmaceutical companies faced off against generic drug makers. At issue was a 2003 law with a loophole used by brand-name drug makers to keep generic competitors off the market. Faced with expiring patents on successful drugs, brand makers in the 1990s began extending their monopoly rights by obtaining &quot;method&quot; patents on use of the medications. Such patents could give brand-makers longer exclusivity, but the U.S. ...
