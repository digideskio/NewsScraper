A spike in bond yields has brought Europe's debt crisis back to the forefront. U.S. economic figures point to steady-but-uninspired growth, and stocks have backed off the sharp gains that recently pushed indexes to near four-year highs. Stocks returned a bit to their winning track this week after strong earnings reports, and investors are waiting to see if more positive surprises from U.S. companies are in store. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Brent crude's gains could not prevent a second straight weekly loss, while U.S. crude managed a 22-cent weekly gain as the expiring May contract went off the board higher, though well below its intraday peak as Wall Street pared gains.

     <description>
      (Reuters) - General Electric Co's first quarter earnings slightly beat Wall Street expectations, helped by strong sales of jet engines and energy equipment, as well as profit growth at its finance arm GE Capital. Profit excluding special items was 34 cents a share at the largest U.S. conglomerate, a penny above the average analyst forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 8.2 percent to $35.18 billion, due in part to the sale of NBC Universal, but beat Wall Street's expectation of $34.7 billion.
