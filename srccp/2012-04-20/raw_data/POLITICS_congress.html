     <description>
      When House Appropriations Committee ranking member Norm Dicks, D-Wash., announced earlier this year that he will retire in November, Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio became the heir apparent to the top Democratic post on the committee. Kaptur, who came to Congress in 1983, has served on Appropriations since 1990 and would be the first woman to assume the ranking-member or chair position on the powerful committee.
