The source, Vietnamese blog Tinhte, has a solid track record of publishing images, videos and other details surrounding unreleased devices, and the smartphone shown off by the blog is believed to be authentic. In an interesting twist, however, this may not be the Galaxy S III we see announced on May 3rd during Samsung’s “Unpacked” event in London. Read on for more. The smartphone pictured carries the model number i9300, which a trusted BGR source has confirmed belongs to the next-generation Galaxy S smartphone.

The source, Vietnamese blog Tinhte, has a solid track record of publishing images, videos and other details surrounding unreleased devices, and the smartphone shown off by the blog is believed to be authentic. In an interesting twist, however, this may not be the Galaxy S III we see announced on May 3rd during Samsung’s “Unpacked” event in London. Read on for more. The smartphone pictured carries the model number i9300, which a trusted BGR source has confirmed belongs to the next-generation Galaxy S smartphone. According to Tinhte, the phone features a quad-core 1.4GHz processor, a 4.6-inch 720p HD display, Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
