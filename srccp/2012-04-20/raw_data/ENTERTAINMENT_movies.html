Obama's Deputy Campaign Manager Julianna Smoot announced a contest via email on Thursday that grants the winner and a guest access to a posh Hollywood fundraiser for the president. Here's the kicker: The swanky dinner will be held at Clooney's L.A. home. ...

Coss and Sippola, who were in a relationship at the time, challenged their convictions, claiming the extortion law was vague and therefore unconstitutional. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>&quot;Spider-man&quot; trailer has more lizard, daddy issues</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Peter Parker has a whole lot of daddy issues and a scaly, slithering, super-freaky villain to deal with in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man.&quot; That's the take-away from a new international trailer for the upcoming reboot of Sony's superhero franchise. The latest preview gives audiences a more extensive look at Rhys Ifans' villainous Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard, who is big, green and administering a smack-down on Manhattan motorists. This reptilian baddie has serious road-rage. It also appears that the orphaned Peter's father had some kind of business association with Connors. ...

     <title>3D 'Titanic' posts China's best box office bow ever</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap) - The 3D re-release of &quot;Titanic&quot; recorded the best box office opening ever in China this weekend, claiming $58 million for international distributor Fox. Universal got some good news, too. It opened its pricey &quot;Battleship&quot; in 26 territories - not including China - and took in $58 million. That represents a pretty good payoff on the studio's early overseas opening strategy. The movie will roll out in the U.S. on May 18. The huge China opening for &quot;Titanic&quot; and receipts from 69 other territories upped the global haul in its second overseas weekend to $88.2 million. ...

The stuntman swerved to avoid hitting extras while careering through the Grand Bazaar at high speed, the NTV news channel said, but then crashed into the jewellery shop and smashed its crystal glass window. &quot;It is very nice for the Grand Bazaar to be chosen as a location for shooting this kind of movie.
