     <description>

     <description>
      (Reuters) - Guan Tian-Lang missed the halfway cut at the China Open on Friday, a day after the 13-year-old Chinese became the youngest golfer to play in a European Tour event. The schoolboy prodigy followed up his opening round five-over-par 77 with an erratic 79 to drop way below the cut line at Tianjin's Binhai Lake Golf Club. Guan, who earned a slice of history by just teeing off at Tianjin, found going really tough on Friday and began with the first of his seven bogeys. The 10th tee starter managed just a couple of birdies to go with a double bogey. ...
