     <title>Colleges angle for influential foreign students like Bo Guagua</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - His academic record was spotty, but as he applied for graduate studies in the United States, Bo Guagua would have looked like quite a catch to many universities, according to researchers who study college admissions. The young man had deep connections to China's elite; his father was an up-and-coming politician poised to enter the Communist Party leadership and his mother came from a renowned military family.

     <title>Online Education Helped Me Achieve My Goals</title>
     <description>
      I am fortunate to come from a well educated family. My parents were both college graduates, and all four grandparents have higher education of one sort or another. So, it was never a question of whether or not I would go to college, as I had wanted to my entire life. It was always just a matter of when I would attend, and for what educational purpose I sought.

     <title>First Person: The Top 10 Benefits of Getting My Degree Online</title>
     <description>
      If you're interested in earning a degree, attending an online college can be a practical and cost-effective way to go. I returned to school in 2008, seven years after receiving my bachelor's, and a year and a half later I'd earned my master's degree without ever setting foot inside a classroom. While online learning isn't for everyone, I loved everything about my experience, and I'll definitely go that route if I return to school in the future. From the perspective of someone who's been there and done that, here are the top 10 benefits of earning a degree online.

     <title>The Economic Reality Behind HBO's 'Girls'</title>
     <description>
      In the opening scene of HBO's new show &quot;Girls,&quot; Hannah, a 23-year-old college grad living in New York City, flips out when her parents tell her she's cut off--they're not giving her anymore money. As two professors, they simply can't afford it anymore, her mother says, and besides, her mom wants to afford luxuries of her own, such as a lake house. Why should they continue paying Hannah's rent, two years after college graduation?
