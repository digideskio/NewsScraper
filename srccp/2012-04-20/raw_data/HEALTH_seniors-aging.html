     <title>Will Your Passion Dim in Retirement?</title>
     <description>
      To enjoy a fulfilling and meaningful retirement, you need to identify what you are passionate about and figure out a way to pursue that activity. Living each day with the simplistic goal of just keeping busy can kill some hours. But to really enjoy retired life, there should be a purpose for each day.

     <title>First Person: I'm Retiring Outside the United States</title>
     <description>
      I recently started dating someone and we have one big thing in common. We both want to retire outside the United States. I know what some of you might be thinking: I must be some anti-American socialist. Don't get me wrong, I love America. But where things stand with my finances, the political and economic direction my country is going in, and my philosophy on life, I know deep down retiring outside the United States is the right thing for me.

     <title>What the Longevity Economy Could Mean for You</title>
     <description>
      Aging Americans are often viewed as an enormous financial burden. They are racking up outsized healthcare and retirement obligations that are bankrupting the federal and state governments. Upwards of 10,000 baby boomers are reaching traditional retirement age each day, signing up for Medicare and Social Security, and for those with low incomes, using Medicaid services. Beyond lots of plans and even more talk, there is no overall government strategy in place to deal with these expenses.

     <description>
      PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi said on Thursday it would collaborate with the Michael J. Fox Foundation to test an early- stage experimental treatment for Parkinson's disease. Under the terms of the collaboration, MJFF will sponsor a phase I clinical trial to study the safety and tolerability of Sanofi's AVE8112, a drug that has shown promise in preclinical tests as a therapy for some of the psychiatric symptoms of the disease.

     <title>How to Protect Against Alzheimer's Disease</title>
     <description>
      Charles Snelling spent six years taking care of his Alzheimer's-stricken wife, Adrienne, helpless as he watched the disease steal his college sweetheart. In March, after six decades of marriage, Snelling killed his longtime partner, and then he killed himself. Both were 81. &quot;After apparently reaching the point where he could no longer bear to see the love of his life deteriorate further, our father ended our mother's life and then took his own life as well,&quot; his children said in a statement. ...

     <title>Why Retirees Will Benefit from Tax Deferral</title>
     <description>
      There is no question that almost everyone should contribute enough to their 401(k) to get the employer match. But once you get the maximum possible match, where should you invest additional funds? You can continue to save in a 401(k) or allocate some money to a Roth IRA.

     <title>Social Security Claiming Slows</title>
     <description>
      Social Security sign-ups spiked in 2009, when a record high of 3.2 million Americans age 62 and older began collecting benefits. But the number of people newly claiming Social Security has since declined to 3.1 million in 2010 and 3 million in 2011, according to a recent Urban Institute analysis of Social Security Administration data.

     <title>First Person: I Am Still Confident About My Retirement</title>
     <description>
      I am a member of Generation X and I can remember a time when it was forecast that my generation would not necessarily accomplish very much. In fact, I can remember the number of documents that suggested our generation would actually do a great deal of harm to the planet with our sinister Walkmans and bad attitudes.

     <title>Seniors: How to Put Together the Right Medical Team</title>
     <description>
      For anyone past the age of 60, now is the time to carefully plan for your future physician needs. You will live, on average, into your mid-80s. Who will take care of you during this period? Will your current doctors be around then? Ask them. Do they have succession plans in their practices? Ask them. If you're not satisfied with the responses, build a personal action plan to locate doctors who will best meet your needs as you age.

     <title>First Person: The 6-Step Retirement Plan</title>
     <description>
      Most of us know that we should have some sort of retirement plan in place, but actually having one might be something else altogether. Personally, I've had a retirement plan of sorts in the works since I graduated from college. And while this plan has changed and evolved over the years, the end-goal -- retiring at a reasonable age and in a financial situation that allows for comfort and security -- has remained the same.

     <title>How Baby Boomers are Picking a Retirement Age</title>
     <description>
      Baby boomers have a variety of ways of deciding when they are ready for retirement. Almost half (45 percent) of the oldest baby boomers have already retired, according to a recent GfK Custom Research North America survey commissioned by the MetLife Mature Market Institute. The telephone survey of 1,012 people born in 1946 found that only about a quarter (24 percent) of these baby boomers are still employed full time, while the rest are working part time or seasonally, on disability, self-employed, or looking for work. Here's how the oldest baby boomers are choosing when to retire:
