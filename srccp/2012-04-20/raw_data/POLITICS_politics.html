     <description>
      MANAMA (Reuters) - Cancelling Sunday's Bahrain Formula One Grand Prix would only &quot;empower extremists&quot;, the country's Crown Prince told reporters on Friday as police in the small Gulf state battled to put down pro-democracy protests. Prince Salman did not respond directly to questions about whether he could guarantee the safety of teams, however, saying instead that he was able to guarantee that the protests were not directed against Formula One. ...

     <description>
      MANAMA (Reuters) - At least 5,000 demonstrators gathered close to Manama, the capital of Bahrain, on Friday as a three-day Grand Prix got underway in a country that has been convulsed by more than a year of pro-democracy protests. The protesters - from the majority Shi'ite community - assembled in the Budaiya area near Manama. They say they feel sidelined by a Sunni-controlled ruling elite, and have made it clear they want to use the world's focus on the glitzy Formula One event to air their grievances. ...
