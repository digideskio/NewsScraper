His newest book begins where the first left off with a new goal of 90 days. But this time around, Clegg is not out to kill himself with endless sleep-deprived, paranoid nights on cocaine. Instead, it's an account of getting sober and a journey of relapse and recovery. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Whedon's script (co-written with director Drew Goddard) contains such delicious twists and turns, however, that it's hard to discuss the film without spoiling the fun for uninitiated viewers. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Book Talk: Deceit and espionage in darkest Luxembourg</title>
     <description>
      TOKYO (Reuters) - The worst thing about Kate's life in Luxembourg as the trailing spouse of a man hired to work on banking security at first simply appears to be the boredom of spending days among fellow housewives after giving up her career. But Kate, the heroine of Chris Pavone's debut novel &quot;The Expats,&quot; is a former CIA agent who has never told her husband what she did. As she seeks both to escape her past deeds and become a new person, she starts to become suspicious not only of her husband Dexter's doings but those of a couple whose friendliness may not be quite what it seems. ...

Written by Laura Lau and directed by Lau and Chris Kentis (the married couple's previous film was &quot;Open Water&quot;), this low-budget indie is filmed in a series of extended takes. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Unless, of course, it involves an actor — even one as talented as the great Ruby Dee — actually saying out loud, &quot;Family is what's important,&quot; which is a cue to leave the theater and spend one's valuable time teaching a nephew to fly a kite rather than wasting two hours on another sanctimonious Hollywood feel-good movie. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Both are based on books by authors with devoted followings: Warner Bros.' &quot;Lucky One&quot; on a novel by romance king Nicholas Sparks, and Sony's Screen Gems release on an advice book by comedian Steve Harvey. After four consecutive victories, &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; is expected to come in third with $13 million to $14 million. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

By the end of the new movie &quot;Think Like a Man,&quot; you will have no doubt in your mind that Steve Harvey has written a book entitled &quot;Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man.&quot; Mainly because the characters in the movie keep talking about Steve Harvey and his book, &quot;Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man.&quot; And even Steve Harvey pops up periodically to discuss his book, &quot;Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man. ...

     <title>Review: Efron is all grown up in 'The Lucky One'</title>
     <description>
      &quot;The Lucky One&quot; is yet another adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, so you know exactly what you're getting walking into this thing. It's predictable and schmaltzy and sappy and smothered with voiceover that explains the film's already none-too-subtle themes of destiny and fate and second chances.
