     <title>Warden's wife who helped killer escape is freed</title>
     <description>
      OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - The odd case of Bobbi Parker, a prison official's wife convicted of helping a killer escape and then spending more than decade posing as his wife, took another twist on Thursday with her release from prison. Parker, 49, was allowed out early for good behavior after serving half of her one-year sentence, Oklahoma prison spokesman Jerry Massie said. A jury found her guilty last year of helping convicted murderer Randolph Franklin Dial escape in 1994 from the prison where Parker's husband served as assistant warden. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - A Catholic bishop in Kansas City must stand trial on charges that he failed to report a priest found with pornographic pictures of young girls on his Church computer to police, a judge said on Thursday. Bishop Robert Finn, head of the Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, faces one misdemeanor charge that he failed to tell authorities that Church officials had found disturbing pictures of unclothed little girls that appeared to have been taken by a popular local priest, Father Patrick Ratigan. His trial is set to start September 24. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Secondary lead smelters are paying near record prices for junk batteries, their raw material feed, because drivers are not replacing their car batteries due to the unseasonably warmer winter in the Northern Hemisphere. The price rise has been driven by a scarcity of spent batteries, used to make 90 percent of the United States' lead output. Lead-acid batteries in cars and trucks are lasting longer due to the milder weather. ...
