     <title>Sex education stagnating in U.S. schools, CDC says</title>
     <description>
      ATLANTA (Reuters) - Public schools in the United States are making &quot;little progress&quot; in expanding instruction in how to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV, a new federal study concluded. Between 2008 and 2010, the percentage of public schools teaching key topics on prevention did not increase in the 45 states surveyed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In middle schools, 11 states saw declines during the two-year period and no state saw an increase, the CDC said. The level of instruction was stable in high schools. ...

     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brian Sack, who oversees the U.S. Federal Reserve's dealings with Wall Street and was seen as a &quot;rising star&quot; within the central bank, will resign from his post later this year, the New York Fed said on its website on Thursday. Sack, 41, has been the head of the New York Federal Reserve's markets group since June 2009. His tenure includes the implementation of the central bank's unconventional measures to stabilize the banking system and pull the U.S. economy out the worst recession since the Great Depression. &quot;Mr. ...

     <title>Garage sale find: $130 million in Coke stock?</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - George Soros and John Paulson may have to make room for the late Tony Marohn, who possibly pulled off one of the greatest financial trades ever -- at an estate sale. Marohn's family claims it is owed a $130 million stake in Coca-Cola Co after Marohn bought an antique Palmer Union Oil Co stock certificate in 2008 for a &quot;nominal amount,&quot; Marohn family attorney David Margules said on Thursday. Marohn traced Palmer Union Oil to Coca-Cola, by way of long-forgotten companies such as Petrocarbon Chemicals Inc and Taylor Wine Co, according to court documents. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama believes women should be allowed to join the all-male Augusta National Golf Club, the White House said on Thursday, adding pressure on the exclusive 80-year-old organization to change its restrictive policy. &quot;His personal opinion is that women should be admitted,&quot; White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters, saying he had spoken to Obama about the issue. &quot;We are kind of long past the time when women should be excluded from anything,&quot; Carney said as the first round of the Masters tournament got under way at the Augusta club in Georgia. ...

     <title>JCPenney to cut 900 jobs in Texas and Pittsburgh</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc said on Thursday that it will cut about 900 jobs, including roughly 600 at its headquarters, as it trims costs and tries to start running its 110-year-old business more like a nimble start-up. The Plano, Texas-based retailer, which has already overhauled its pricing strategy under new chief executive Ron Johnson, said it plans to close a customer call center in Pittsburgh, affecting about 300 employees. As of late January, Penney had about 159,000 employees, including part-time workers. ...

     <description>
      (Reuters) - ITC Holdings Corp on Thursday turned on power transmission equipment along the Michigan-Ontario border in hopes of making the power flow more reliably and efficiently.

     <title>El Nino possible after summer, CPC says</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Climate Prediction Center raised the prospect that El Nino conditions could return after the Northern Hemisphere summer, causing adverse weather that could potentially disrupt the harvest of vital crops such as cotton, corn and soybeans. A return in the fall of La Nina's more infamous counterpart could increase rainfall, although farmers typically prefer it to the La Nina phenomenon. La Nina has been blamed for a bad dry spell in South America. ...

Buford is one of two tiny Western towns to be sold by owners whose spouses have died and whose adult children have moved on.

     <description>
      SALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - A data security breach at the Utah Health Department, believed to be the work of Eastern European hackers, has exposed 24,000 U.S. Medicaid files bearing names, Social Security numbers and other private information, state officials said on Wednesday. The intrusion initially appeared to have affected claims representing at least 9 percent of the 260,000 clients of Medicaid in Utah. But because each file often contains information on more than one individual, the full extent of the breach is probably wider, officials said. ...

      CHICAGO (Reuters) - The city of Chicago agreed on Wednesday to allow opponents of Afghanistan war to stage a march during the two-day NATO summit of world leaders in May, according to a protest organizer. The city had earlier denied activists a permit to parade on May 20, the first day of the two-day summit of the military alliance, saying the proposed march would clog traffic and over-tax police resources. But on Wednesday, just hours before activists planned to file suit in federal court, the city relented and said it would allow a march on May 20, protest leader Andy Thayer said. ...

     <title>Sex education stagnating in U.S. schools, CDC says</title>
     <description>
      ATLANTA (Reuters) - Public schools in the United States are making &quot;little progress&quot; in expanding instruction in how to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV, a new federal study concluded. Between 2008 and 2010, the percentage of public schools teaching key topics on prevention did not increase in the 45 states surveyed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In middle schools, 11 states saw declines during the two-year period and no state saw an increase, the CDC said. The level of instruction was stable in high schools. ...

     <title>Garage sale find: $130 million in Coke stock?</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - George Soros and John Paulson may have to make room for the late Tony Marohn, who possibly pulled off one of the greatest financial trades ever -- at an estate sale. Marohn's family claims it is owed a $130 million stake in Coca-Cola Co after Marohn bought an antique Palmer Union Oil Co stock certificate in 2008 for a &quot;nominal amount,&quot; Marohn family attorney David Margules said on Thursday. Marohn traced Palmer Union Oil to Coca-Cola, by way of long-forgotten companies such as Petrocarbon Chemicals Inc and Taylor Wine Co, according to court documents. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama believes women should be allowed to join the all-male Augusta National Golf Club, the White House said on Thursday, adding pressure on the exclusive 80-year-old organization to change its restrictive policy. &quot;His personal opinion is that women should be admitted,&quot; White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters, saying he had spoken to Obama about the issue. &quot;We are kind of long past the time when women should be excluded from anything,&quot; Carney said as the first round of the Masters tournament got under way at the Augusta club in Georgia. ...

      (Reuters) - ITC Holdings Corp on Thursday turned on power transmission equipment along the Michigan-Ontario border in hopes of making the power flow more reliably and efficiently.

     <title>JCPenney to cut 900 jobs in Texas and Pittsburgh</title>
     <description>
      (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc said on Thursday that it will cut about 900 jobs, including roughly 600 at its headquarters, as it trims costs and tries to start running its 110-year-old business more like a nimble start-up. The Plano, Texas-based retailer, which has already overhauled its pricing strategy under new chief executive Ron Johnson, said it plans to close a customer call center in Pittsburgh, affecting about 300 employees. As of late January, Penney had about 159,000 employees, including part-time workers. ...

     <title>El Nino possible after summer, CPC says</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Climate Prediction Center raised the prospect that El Nino conditions could return after the Northern Hemisphere summer, causing adverse weather that could potentially disrupt the harvest of vital crops such as cotton, corn and soybeans. A return in the fall of La Nina's more infamous counterpart could increase rainfall, although farmers typically prefer it to the La Nina phenomenon. La Nina has been blamed for a bad dry spell in South America. ...
