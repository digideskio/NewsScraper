With the earnings season starting next week, the outlook is not as sunny as in previous quarters. Investors will assess whether slower growth is priced into the U.S. stock market, or if the S&amp;P 500's retreat from Monday's four-year high is the start of a larger decline - if results disappoint. Fund managers will look for earnings to offer insight into how companies are faring amid mixed economic indicators and a resurgence of concerns about Europe. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer signed the previously announced series of settlements on Wednesday but the approval was not made public until Thursday.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 357,000, the lowest level since April 2008, the Labor Department said on Thursday. But the claims data could bolster the case that the healing labor market is lowering the need for the Federal Reserve to do more to boost growth. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Of the 20 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters, 10 beat Wall Street sales estimates, with the biggest increases coming from clothing sellers. Victoria's Secret parent Limited Brands Inc, Target Corp, Macy's Inc and Gap Inc were among the retailers that beat analysts' expectations for sales at stores open at least a year as they lured shoppers with blue, yellow and pink clothes and other spring merchandise. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Athens must in any case make a decision soon, in coordination with its EU and IMF backers, because a 450 million euro bond expires on May 15, finance ministry and banking officials said. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Exclusive: China ship insurer deals new blow to Iran oil exports</title>
     <description>
      SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A major Chinese ship insurer will halt indemnity cover for tankers carrying Iranian oil from July, dealing a blow that narrows the insurance options for Tehran's main export already constricted by payment barriers caused by Western sanctions.

      MOSCOW (Reuters) - Retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc has let caution thwart its ambitions in Russia, and will find profits harder to come by if it delays getting a foothold in the vast market catering to 140 million people. Fearful of getting hamstrung by Russia's complicated and time-consuming bureaucracy, the world number one retailer has been outmaneuvered by its European peers - Auchan and Metro have become the third and fourth biggest food retailers in the $300 billion-plus market. ...
