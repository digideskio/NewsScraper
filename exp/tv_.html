     <title>A last dance for Jack Wagner on &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot;</title>
     <description>
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - Last year was both a good one and, it turns out, a bad one for soap opera actor Jack Wagner as his Samba to &quot;Lighting Up the Night&quot; spelled the end of his competing on &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot; on Tuesday. Wagner, 52, was sent packing during the TV show's &quot;most-memorable year&quot; themed week in which the dancers selected a particular year for inspiration. The actor, who was partnered with professional ballroom dancer Anna Trebunskaya, chose 2011 as his most memorable when he discovered he had a daughter. ...

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - The second season of HBO's swords-and-dragons epic fantasy series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; got off to a bloody good start in more ways than one. Sunday night's Season 2 premiere easily trounced the impressive viewership of the show's series premiere last year and handily bested last season's average and finale viewership. Over three airings Sunday night, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; amassed 6.3 million total viewers, with the 9 p.m. premiere airing alone drawing 3.9 million viewers. ...

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Netflix and Hulu are convincing millions of cable subscribers to cut the cord and dive into video streaming. That's the conclusion of a new report released this week by the Convergence Consulting Group, which found that&nbsp;2.65 million Americans canceled cable between 2008-2011 in favor of lower-cost Internet subscription services or video platforms. The Canadian research firm estimates that 112,000 U.S. and Canadian subscribers were added to the cable rolls in 2011. That represents a more than 50 percent drop from the 272,000 who signed up for the service in 2010. ...

      NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - Mitt Romney has racked up some high profile endorsements in the last week, but his dad didn't get one from &quot;Mad Men&quot; character Henry Francis. On Sunday's episode, Betty's new husband received a work call while the couple waited for test results to see if she had cancer. Whoever was calling wanted Henry's boss, New York Mayor John Lindsay, to appear with Michigan Gov. George Romney. (This season, remember, is set in 1966.) Henry gave his caller the brush off: &quot;Well, tell Jim his honor's not going to Michigan. ...

AMC's drama had its second season premiere Sunday night, and it appears that the series has dropped a number of viewers compared to its first season premiere.
