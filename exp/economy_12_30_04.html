Economists reckon the Games will, at best, give the economy a minor and temporary fillip. The Olympics could lift the mood of a country in the grip of austerity measures, but experts say it will be difficult to maintain that momentum. Britain has dropped its traditional reserve and is going for the hard sell when the Olympics returns to London for the first time since 1948. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

The rand was at 7.827 against the dollar at 1540 GMT, little changed from Wednesday's New York close of 7.832. Earlier in the session the currency had been under pressure due to concerns about sovereign debt risk in the euro zone after a poor Spanish debt auction, and a dip in long-term economic confidence suggested by the Reuters Econometer survey. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>March hiring spree stirs hope for Canada's jobless</title>
     <description>
      OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's ailing jobs market sprang back to life in March with a stunning 82,300 net new jobs, the most since September 2008 and a tentative sign that the economy may be growing enough muscle to pressure the central bank to raise interest rates. The job gains reported by Statistics Canada on Thursday were eight times bigger than expected, and were spread fairly evenly across several sectors. Strong private-sector hiring and more full-time positions suggested underlying economic strength. &quot;Hibernation is over for Canadian employment. ...

     <title>Economy grew 0.1 percent in first-quarter, no recession - NIESR</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy avoided a renewed recession by the smallest possible margin, the National Institute of Economic Research (NIESR) estimated on Thursday. Gross domestic product probably grew by 0.1 percent in the first three months of 2012, avoiding a second consecutive drop after a 0.3 percent contraction in the final quarter of 2011, the institute said. &quot;With such weak rates of growth the UK's negative output gap is likely to widen,&quot; NIESR said. &quot;But we do expect this economic weakness to be temporary, with the recovery taking hold in 2013.&quot; (Reporting by Sven Egenter)

     <description>
