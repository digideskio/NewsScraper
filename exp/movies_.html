The legal action is the latest headache for producers of Broadway's most expensive production who have contended with performer injuries from falls or crash-landings during aerial stunts, a bitter dispute with original director and co-creator Julie Taymor, and reviews that have been mostly negative. Still, ticket sales have proven strong at box offices. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>&quot;American Reunion&quot; pie is tasteless</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - It may or may not be true that you can't go home again, but perhaps you shouldn't — judging by &quot;American Reunion,&quot; anyway, which brings back the cast of the 1999 sleeper hit &quot;American Pie&quot; and strands them in a dull and offensive movie that has none of the charm, smarts or sex appeal of the original. Everyone at East Great Falls High apparently missed their 10-year reunion, but they're all coming back for their 13th, a bit bruised by their experiences in the real world, which have apparently lacked the wacky shenanigans of their youth. ...

     <title>Robert Towne talks film classic &quot;Chinatown&quot; on Blu-ray</title>
     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - &quot;Chinatown,&quot; the 1974 film classic released this week on Blu-ray,&nbsp;was forged by a grand design and a series of fortunate accidents. That's one of the takeaways from Paramount's feature-laden Blu-ray version, for which its Oscar-winning screenwriter Robert Towne oversaw the color timing work. The Blu-ray version does full justice to every artful detail, right down to the rich tapestry of browns that was the original. ...

The film is set in an economically depressed section of the northeastern United States and will be directed by Scott Cooper (&quot;Crazy Heart&quot;). Cooper also wrote the screenplay. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

With little money or professional staff, the two asked fans for help and received 1 million euros ($1.31 million).

      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - &quot;That '70s Show&quot; actress Lisa Robin Kelly was arrested on Saturday on felony charges of corporal injury on a spouse and released on $50,000 bail.

At least that seems to be the premise of &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane's feature film debut, &quot;Ted,&quot; based on the red band trailer. The concept is similar to that of FX's TV show &quot;Wilfred,&quot; which features a pot-smoking pet dog who gets Elijah Wood into all kinds of shenanigans. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

At least that seems to be the premise of &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane's feature film debut, &quot;Ted,&quot; based on the red band trailer. The concept is similar to that of FX's TV show &quot;Wilfred,&quot; which features a pot-smoking pet dog who gets Elijah Wood into all kinds of shenanigans. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <description>
      LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - &quot;Chinatown,&quot; the 1974 film classic released this week on Blu-ray,&nbsp;was forged by a grand design and a series of fortunate accidents. That's one of the takeaways from Paramount's feature-laden Blu-ray version, for which its Oscar-winning screenwriter Robert Towne oversaw the color timing work. The Blu-ray version does full justice to every artful detail, right down to the rich tapestry of browns that was the original. ...
