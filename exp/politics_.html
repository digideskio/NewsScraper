     <title>Reflective Chavez weeps at Mass in Venezuela</title>
     <description>
      CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez wept and asked God to spare his life during a pre-Easter Mass on Thursday after returning from his latest session of cancer treatment in Cuba. Very little is known about the 57-year-old socialist leader's condition, including even what type of cancer he has. Chavez has undergone three operations in less than a year, and received two sessions of radiation treatment. He says the latest surgery was successful, that he is recovering well and will be fit to win a new six-year term at an election in October. ...

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday called out his likely opponent for the White House by name for the second time this week and said he &quot;cannot wait&quot; for the chance to pit his vision for America against the Republicans in this year's election. In remarks that underscore the president's shift into full general election-fighting mode, Obama acknowledged Mitt Romney was the front-runner to win the Republican nomination to face him on November 6, and said he relished the upcoming contest. ...

The video, entitled &quot;Federal Worker 'American Idle,'&quot; is certain to spur fresh Republican attacks on President Barack Obama's spending record, which they hope to make a key issue in the 2012 election campaign this fall. ...
