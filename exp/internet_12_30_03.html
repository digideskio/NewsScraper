     <title>Taking Note: Is Samsung's phablet the shape of things to come?</title>

And yet, despite all the sniggering, Samsung Electronics has sold 5 million of the phone/tablet Galaxy Note, helping drive its booming handset profits in the quarter just ended. More than a freak hit, consumer and design experts believe the surprise success of the &quot;phablet&quot; marks a deeper shift in the fast-paced world of mobile devices. The most obvious thing about the Note is its size. Its 5.3 inch screen is almost as wide as the iPhone's screen is long. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>What Would the Internet Look Like If Trolling Were Illegal?</title>
     <description>
      Imagine an Internet on which haters didn't hate. Where there were no mean commenters, no stories that hurt people's pretty little feelings. Everyone would virtually hug at the end of a day, congratulate themselves for a job well done, even if that job was essentially just PR, and we'd probably all drink a lot less. The Daily Mail would cease to exist. Bloggers would become extinct. It would be so boring that those of us who hadn't died of boredom would die of sitting.&nbsp;

It looks like she was right. Multiple sources are reporting that Yahoo, one of the Internet’s oldest companies, is beginning its massive purge today by cutting about 2,000 employees from its roster of 14,000. The layoffs will affect every division of the company, but the local businesses, product research, and marketing sections will be hit the hardest. And more layoffs are likely to come in the days ahead.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

It looks like she was right. Multiple sources are reporting that Yahoo, one of the Internet’s oldest companies, is beginning its massive purge today by cutting about 2,000 employees from its roster of 14,000. The layoffs will affect every division of the company, but the local businesses, product research, and marketing sections will be hit the hardest. And more layoffs are likely to come in the days ahead.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Tale of the tape: Google versus Facebook</title>
     <description>
      Google Inc. is taking the threat posed by Facebook Inc.'s Internet social network more seriously since co-founder Larry Page returned as CEO a year ago. Although Facebook is far smaller than Google, Page is worried the social network is gaining valuable insight into its users' lives that could lure away online advertisers.
