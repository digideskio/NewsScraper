     <title>South Sudan says Sudan tried to build &quot;illegal&quot; oil pipeline</title>
     <description>
      JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan accused Sudan of trying to build an &quot;illegal&quot; 25-km oil pipeline crossing the border towards the South's oil fields, a day after talks to resolve a damaging oil dispute between the two sides were postponed. A Sudanese government spokesman was not immediately available to comment.

      SANAA/ADEN (Reuters) - At least 10 suspected militants were killed in air strikes in southern Yemen on Thursday, and authorities reinforced security at foreign missions and government sites in Sanaa over warnings of a possible al Qaeda attack in the capital.

Bossi, who started off in the 1980s attacking Italy's corrupt political system, hastily resigned on Thursday, crushed by judicial allegations that party money had been used to pay for his family extravaganzas, including the renovation of his villa and travel and expensive cars for his children. ...
