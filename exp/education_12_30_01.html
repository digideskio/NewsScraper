     <description>

     <description>
      PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona's Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed into law on Tuesday a bill to ban medical marijuana from being used on the campuses of state universities and community colleges in the latest salvo in a long-running battle over legalization of the drug.

Still, the third straight year of double-digit returns on its massive investment portfolio failed to close Teachers' funding shortfall, which narrowed to C$9.6 billion from C$17.2 billion in 2010. ...

     <title>CPS, Teachers Union Negotiations Underway</title>
     <description>
      According to the Chicago Tribune, the first round of negotiations between the Chicago Teachers Union and Chicago Public Schools is underway and the union has agreed to let CPS give more weight to student performance when evaluating teachers. But the sides are moving on to the debate over salaries, a topic that might prove difficult to agree on. CPS has proposed a salary system that would reward teachers who take on jobs at low-income schools or positions that are typically hard for CPS to fill. The union also asked for a 30 percent pay raise over two years.

     <title>Judge dismisses Virginia Tech fine for slow alert</title>
     <description>
      RICHMOND, Virginia (Reuters) - A judge has thrown out a fine imposed by federal education officials against Virginia Tech, finding the school did not wait too long under federal law to alert students of the first shootings in a 2007 rampage that left 32 innocent people dead. The U.S. Department of Education last year ordered the university to pay a $55,000 fine, the maximum allowed for violations of the federal Clery Act, which requires timely warnings of crimes on campuses. University officials waited more than two hours before notifying the campus that a shooting had occurred. ...
