With the earnings season starting next week, the outlook is not as sunny as in previous quarters. Investors will assess whether slower growth is priced into the U.S. stock market, or if the S&amp;P 500's retreat from Monday's four-year high is the start of a larger decline - if results disappoint. Fund managers will look for earnings to offer insight into how companies are faring amid mixed economic indicators and a resurgence of concerns about Europe. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

      BAMAKO (Reuters) - Mali's neighbors could soon lift economic and diplomatic sanctions imposed on the West African country with the aim of forcing last month's coup leaders to quit power, a regional mediator said after talks with the junta leader on Thursday. &quot;We are going to do everything so that these sanctions are not only suspended but completely removed. We are getting there,&quot; Burkina Faso Foreign Minister Djibril Bassole told Malian television after talks with coup leader Captain Amadou Sanogo. &quot;I can assure you that the captain is aware and taking measures. ...

The 82,300 jobs added in March was the largest monthly job increase since September 2008, Statistics Canada said on Thursday. It was also eight times higher than the gain of 10,000 jobs that had been predicted by economists in a Reuters survey. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>IMF warns of economic overheating risks in Russia</title>
     <description>
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian economic growth is running at or ahead of its potential and there is a risk of overheating from a planned increase in the 2012 non-oil budget deficit, an International Monetary Fund spokesman said on Thursday. &quot;The budgeted increase in the non-oil deficit of 2012 poses a risk of overheating,&quot; IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told a briefing for reporters. &quot;We believe the government should take advantage of high oil prices by reducing its non-oil deficit and saving windfall oil revenues in the reserve fund. ...

     <title>Gold recovers some of its losses; oil rises again</title>
     <description>
      Gold on Thursday recovered some of the previous day's losses, rising about 1 percent. But it's still down sharply for the week, a victim of the Federal Reserve's prediction that it won't need to take more steps to stimulate the economy.

He reiterated, however, that Brazil has not yet made up its mind. &quot;By late next week Brazil should have a position on the matter, and I will talk with the other BRICS,&quot; Mantega told reporters in Brasilia. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Mantega met earlier on Thursday with the U.S. nominee for the top post, Jim Yong Kim, whom Mantega said showed vast experience in the developing world. He reiterated, however, that Brazil has not yet made up its mind. &quot;By late next week Brazil should have a position on the matter, and I will talk with the other BRICS,&quot; Mantega told reporters in Brasilia. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
