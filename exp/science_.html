     <title>Ice age data bolsters greenhouse gas, warming link</title>
     <description>
      The dramatic temperature increases that thawed the last ice age followed spikes in carbon dioxide levels in the air, a new study finds. Researchers say that further strengthens the scientific case explaining current man-made global warming.

     <title>US Military Wants Humanoid Robots in the Driver's Seat</title>
     <description>
      A U.S. military agency once focused on self-driving robot cars has turned its attention to humanoid robots that could roam tomorrow's battlefields. An upcoming announcement suggests the military wants robots that can steer a vehicle from the driver's seat, use a key to open a locked door, climb a ladder and perform handyman repairs.

     <title>Young Asteroids Got Smacked Around Just As Earth Did</title>
     <description>
      Shortly after Earth and Mars were born, they found themselves in a lengthy bout of cosmic bumper cars with comets and space rocks. A new study now suggests the asteroids of the inner solar system were also subjected to such impacts.

     <title>Scientists Closing in on Black Hole at Center of Our Galaxy</title>
     <description>
      Though scientists have suspected for a while that a giant black hole lurks at the center of our galaxy, they still can't say for sure it's the explanation for the strange behavior observed there. Now researchers are closer than ever to being able to image this region and probe the physics at work – potentially shedding light on the great conflict between the theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics.

     <title>Half of Giant Panda Habitat May Vanish in 70 Years, Scientists Say</title>
     <description>
      For all their cuteness, giant pandas are in a tight spot. There are fewer than 1,600 pandas left in the wild, and a new study found that more than half of the bears' already diminished natural habitat will be unlivable in 70 years thanks to climate change.

     <title>Strange Gamma-Ray Objects in Deep Space Perplex Scientists</title>
     <description>
      The universe is filled with high-energy radiation, much of which is made of gamma rays belched out by strange pulsing stars and the remnants of supernova explosions. But a new study of some of most extreme objects has turned up a mystery: nearly one-third of all gamma-ray emitting objects seen to date defy identification.

     <title>&quot;Speed of light&quot; experiment professor resigns</title>
     <description>
      ROME (Reuters) - The Italian professor who led an experiment which initially appeared to challenge one of the fundaments of modern physics by showing particles moving faster than the speed of light, has resigned after the finding was overturned earlier this month. Italy's national institute of nuclear physics INFN said on Friday that Antonio Ereditato had stepped down as coordinator of the so-called OPERA experiment but had no comment beyond saying it &quot;took note&quot; of his decision. It was not immediately possible to reach Ereditato for a comment. ...
