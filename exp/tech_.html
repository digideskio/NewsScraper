The Note - part phone, part mini-tablet - with a throwback stylus and screen half the size of the iPad, has sold more than 5 million since launching in October, and is proving a surprise money earner for the South Korean electronics giant that has a reputation as a 'fast follower' rather than design leader. ...

     <title>Life Is Dangerous Enough Without Google Project Glass Eyewear</title>
     <description>
      COMMENTARY | If I was a really paranoid person, I could find a gajillion dangers to worry about: natural disasters, weapons of mass destruction, stranger danger, stinging vectors, exploding things (my pet phobia). Just walking down the stairs can be treacherous. Now Google wants to imperil me even further with its Project Glass eyewear. PCWorld calls the glasses-cum-smart phone (complete with microphone, web browser and console of tech impedimenta) &quot;jaw-dropping innovation.&quot; I call the thing an accident looking for a place to happen.
