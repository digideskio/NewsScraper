YahooRssConfig file contains the configruation info about parsing the Yahoo RSS.

Leading publisher info(eg: "(Reuters) -" ) is throwed
if the content ends with "./!/? ...", then "..." is throwed
if the content ends with [...], since the sentence is not complete, so the whole content is abandoned
if the content ends with "...", and the sentence is incomplete, the whole content is abandoned

after scraping the text from yahoo news, some of the tags are at wrong position, for eg:
<link /> http://xxxx instead of <link> http://xxx </link>
or like: <source><source/>Reuters instead of <source>Reusters</source>

Some rss are abandoned: 
	"Dear Abby" seems not very useful, 
	"all politics" in POLITICS category is the same as "politics" in US category, "all politics" from POLITICS is picked
	"theater" under ENTERTAINMENT category and "world" under POLITICS category are abaondoned since rss are currently unavailable
