Statistics Category:
a: perfect news, eg: Singer Nicki Minaj	performs a free concert at	Times Square.
b: existing general knowledge, eg: Obama is the president of United States.
c: one of the two arguments is not infromative, eg: This application is known for proper handling of global communication
d: both arguments are not informative, eg: He likes his idea.
e: extraction is fine, but meaningless, eg: A photo is still a photo
f: extraction has different meaning from the original sentence, eg:thw world's largest listed oil firm was the product of nearly a year of talks

Leading publisher info(eg: "(Reuters) -" ) is throwed
if the content ends with "./!/? ...", then "..." is throwed
if the content ends with [...], since the sentence is not complete, so the whole content is abandoned
if the content ends with "...", and the sentence is incomplete, the whole content is abandoned

after scraping the text from yahoo news, some of the tags are at wrong position, for eg:
<link /> http://xxxx instead of <link> http://xxx </link>
or like: <source><source/>Reuters instead of <source>Reusters</source>

Some rss are abandoned: 
	"Dear Abby" seems not very useful, 
	"all politics" in POLITICS category is the same as "politics" in US category, "all politics" from POLITICS is picked
	"theater" under ENTERTAINMENT category and "world" under POLITICS category are abaondoned since rss are currently unavailable

When output data, the prgram doesn't use json's output method, instead, the program print the json string itself. The reason of doing that is because json library provided doing wrong about output utf-8
