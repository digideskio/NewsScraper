Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 357,000, the lowest level since April 2008, the Labor Department said on Thursday. But the claims data could bolster the case that the healing labor market is lowering the need for the Federal Reserve to do more to boost growth. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

Of the 20 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters, 10 beat Wall Street sales estimates, with the biggest increases coming from clothing sellers. Victoria's Secret parent Limited Brands Inc, Target Corp, Macy's Inc and Gap Inc were among the retailers that beat analysts' expectations for sales at stores open at least a year as they lured shoppers with blue, yellow and pink clothes and other spring merchandise. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Analysis: Too slowly, euro zone laggards start to shape up</title>
     <description>
      LONDON (Reuters) - It may be cold comfort for countries on the euro zone's southern periphery mired in recession, but they are making clear strides by some measures towards putting their economies on a sounder long-term footing. After years of excessive debt-fueled consumption at home, Spain and Portugal are seeing a big increase in exports, while Italy's budget deficit is now comfortably below Europe's mandated ceiling of 3 percent of national output. ...

As the world's largest social network hurtles toward a $5 billion initial public offering, it will come under more pressure from Wall Street to find new sources of profit growth and reduce its reliance on advertising, which accounted for 85 percent of its 2011 revenue. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

     <title>Peugeot and Ford end cooperation on larger diesels</title>
     <description>
      PARIS (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen will stop making larger diesel engines with Ford , the companies said, a week after General Motors took a stake in the French automaker to cement their planned alliance. Peugeot and Ford will each develop their own engines to replace diesels of 2 liters and above that they make together, the companies said in a joint statement on Thursday. The two automakers jointly develop and manufacture the bulk of their diesel engines under a 12-year-old agreement. ...

     <description>
      SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A major Chinese ship insurer will halt indemnity cover for tankers carrying Iranian oil from July, dealing a blow that narrows the insurance options for Tehran's main export already constricted by payment barriers caused by Western sanctions. With Western sanctions on Tehran increasing, sources at the China P&amp;I Club told Reuters on Thursday it did not want to stand alone in the market, especially after insurers in Japan and Europe plan to either limit or ban their own coverage for tankers operating in Iran. ...

Fearful of getting hamstrung by Russia's complicated and time-consuming bureaucracy, the world number one retailer has been outmaneuvered by its European peers - Auchan and Metro have become the third and fourth biggest food retailers in the $300 billion-plus market. ...
